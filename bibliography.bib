  abstract = {Abstract  This study is an attempt to analyze students' construction of function based problem solving methods in introductory algebra.
It claims that for functions to be a main concept for learning school algebra, a complex process that has to be developed
during a long period of learning must take place. The article describes a longitudinal observation of a pair of students that
studied algebra for 3 years using a function approach, including intensive use of graphing technology. Such a long observation
is difficult to carry out and even more difficult to report. We watched for three years classrooms using the `Visual-Math'
sequence, and sampled students that exhibited various levels of mathematics achievement. The analysis method presented here
is a non-standard case study of a pair of lower achievers students and their work is often juxtaposed to the work of other
pairs participating in the study. The students' attempts to solve a linear break-even problem is analyzed along three interviews
which present the development of the use of mathematical resources and the patterns of problem solving at different learning
phases. Beyond describing solving attempts, the article offers terms for describing and explaining what and how do learners
appreciate and make out of solving introductory school algebra problems over a three years course.},

We collected verbal protocols from 61 senior (fourth year) engineering students and reanalyzed protocols from 32 freshman (first year) engineering students as they worked on two design problems. The design processes of these student groups were compared. Results show that seniors produced higher quality solutions, spent more time solving the problem, considered more alternative solutions and made more transitions between design steps than the freshmen. This dataset also includes protocols for 18 within-subject participants. These students participated in the study first as freshmen and later as seniors, affording us the opportunity to compare design process changes over time on the individual student level. Finally, this paper includes results for design process differences across the two design problems.},

  abstract = {At the start of their first semester, 35 college freshmen were given an interview probing (a) their differentiation of scientists' ideas from evidence, and hypotheses from theories; (b) their understanding of the inherent uncertainty of scientific knowledge; and (c) their reasoning about scientific controversies. The most common responses were in terms of an epistemology in which scientists' ideas and evidence are differentiated, and theories are understood as tested hypotheses (Level 2 in our system based on Carey, Evans, Honda, Jay, \& Unger, 1989), although students varied in how consistently they differentiated theories and evidence across all questions. Responses in which theories are understood as broader explanatory frameworks guiding hypothesis testing (Level 3) were virtually nonexistent, but some students gave responses that showed awareness of processes of interpreting and reinterpreting patterns of results (Level 2.5). Responses across the three parts of the interview were significantly related. Consistently differentiating scientists' ideas from evidence was strongly related to appreciating the inherent uncertainty of scientific knowledge and with having a deeper understanding of the reasons for scientific controversies and how to resolve them. \textcopyright{} 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Very few of the errors are due to manipulation errors of the symbolic equations. Instead, most errors are due to confusions of symbolic meaning. We also find that performance on symbolic questions is more highly correlated with the overall performance than performance on numeric questions. We devised a coding scheme that distinguishes questions based only on the mathematical structure of the solutions. The coding scheme can be used to identify both difficult and discriminating physics questions. The questions identified by this coding scheme require an algebraic representation and discourage problem solving strategies that do not require an understanding of symbolic equations. Our results suggest that an inability to interpret physics equations may be a major contributor to student failure in introductory physics.},

  abstract = {A theory of action must come to terms with both the details of language use and the way in which the social, cultural, material and sequential structure of the environment where action occurs figure into its organization. In this paper it will be suggested that a primordial site for the analysis of human language, cognition, and action consists of a situation in which multiple participants are attempting to carry out courses of action in concert with each other through talk while attending to both the larger activities that their current actions are ambedded within, and relevant phenomena in their surround. Using as data video recordings of young girls playing hopscotch and archaeologists classifying color, it will be argued that human action is built throught the simultaneous deployment of a range of quite different kinds of semiotic resources. Talk itself contains multiple sign systems with alternative properties. Strips of talk gain their power as social action via their placement within larger sequential structures, encompassing activities, and participation frameworks constituted through displays of mutual orientation made by the actors' bodies. The body is used in a quite different way to perform gesture, again a class of phenomena that encompasses structurally different types of sign systems. Both talk and gesture can index, construe or treat as irrelevant, entities in the participants' surround. Moreover, material structure in the surround, such as graphic fields of various types, can provide semiotic structure without which the constitution of particular kinds of action being invoked through talk would be impossible. In brief it will be argued that the construction of action through talk within situated interaction is accomplished through the temporally unfolding juxtaposition of quite different kinds of semiotic resources, and that moreover through this process the human body is made publicly visible as the site for a range of structurally different kinds of displays implicated in the constitution of the actions of the moment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Engineers are increasingly learning from online courses, in school and the workplace, using online social and informational networks for instruction and to access expertise. Small effective changes in online learning can have large cumulative impact through-out an organization. PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS) This study is a part of a research effort between industry and learning scientists to develop an evidence-based methodology for online learning. We investigate how learning outcomes are impacted by online courses designed to support feedback and formative assessment during learning. DESIGN/METHOD We compared two versions of an online course derived from identical resources. The new course (treatment) used integrated formative assessments to provide feedback to students during learning; focused video resources to anchor the formative assessments; and an instructional design process based on essential concepts to organize the overall design. The course was implemented with a freely available Learning Management System (LMS). RESULTS Treatment course participants learned more overall than did control course participants, with more positive attitudes towards the course content and their future learning. Learning had less dependence on initial knowledge. The collaboration capabilities of the LMS supported course development, but had limited spontaneous use by students during the experiment. CONCLUSIONS The paper demonstrates that formative feedback and design methods which stress essential concepts can make significant differences in learning outcomes in online courses, a straightforward format for implementation, and ways of measuring effectiveness. Areas for further work are integrating feedback with authentic tasks and mining the data produced by student's online activities. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

  abstract = {BackgroundWhile engineering instructional materials and practice problems for pre-college students are often presented in the context of real-life situations, college-level texts are typically written in abstract form.Purpose (Hypothesis)The goal of this study was to jointly examine the impact of contextualizing engineering instruction and varying the number of practice opportunities on pre-college students' learning and learning perceptions.Design/MethodUsing a 3 \texttimes{} 2 factorial design, students were randomly assigned to learn about electrical circuit analysis with an instructional program that represented problems in abstract, contextualized, or both forms, either with two practice problems or four practice problems. The abstract problems were devoid of any real-life context and represented with standard abstract electrical circuit diagrams. The contextualized problems were anchored around real-life scenarios and represented with life-like images. The combined contextualized-abstract condition added abstract circuit diagrams to the contextualized representation. To measure learning, students were given a problem-solving near-transfer post-test. Learning perceptions were measured using a program-rating survey where students had to rate the instructional program's diagrams, helpfulness, and difficulty.ResultsStudents in the combined contextualized-abstract condition scored higher on the post-test, produced better problem representations, and rated the program's diagrams and helpfulness higher than their counterparts. Students who were given two practice problems gave higher program diagram and helpfulness ratings than those given four practice problems.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that pre-college engineering instruction should consider anchoring learning in real-life contexts and providing students with abstract problem representations that can be transferred to a variety of problems.},

  abstract = {Abstract Nearly every emerging profession in the US requires some ability to program (Wing, 2006). However, few students learn any programming (Klein, Cavanagh, Kay, \& Meisinger, 2006). This gap in learning leaves students woefully under-prepared for many of the most rapidly expanding job fields, and the students most likely to be affected by this illiteracy are those who are already most significantly underrepresented in the STEM pipeline (Margolis, Estrella, Goode, Holme, \& Nao, 2008). As a research field, there is much work left to do in understanding how novices learn to program (Pears, Daniels, \& Berglund, 2002); little is known about the optimal pathways for beginners. Many have suggested that tinkering plays a critical role (e.g. Hancock, 2001), and more fine-grained methods could provide more robust descriptions of the relationship between tinkering and learning. Recently, new ways to better understand learning mechanisms have come from learning analytics (Blikstein, 2011) and educational data mining (Baker \& Yacef, 2009). This work uses these methods to show that students learned through a pathway that we term EXTIRE (for exploration, tinkering, and refinement). Our use of these methods has also allowed us to contribute to learning sciences by: showing empirical support for previously theorized processes; enabling us to describe and identify a role of tinkering in novices' learning; and presenting a new approach to creating process descriptions similar to those more typically found in qualitative research. Furthermore, our findings illuminate how tinkering can serve as a valuable approach for novices.},

Sinnes and L{\o}ken thus join a growing literature calling for cultural change in STEM disciplines and careers and providing a model feminist critique that other scholars can use to challenge similar initiatives.},

The upper middle class teens (in these interviews) use language to construct their identities in a way that detaches itself from "everyday" social interaction and orients more towards their personal biographical trajectories through an "achievement space" defined by the (deeply aligned) norms of their families, schools, and powerful institutions in our society. In addition, the upper middle class teens use the abstract language of rational argumentation to "cloak" (of "defer") their quite personal interests and fears, while the working class teens use a personalized narrative (i.e., story-based) language to encode their values, interests, and themes.},

Using an interactional ethnographic approach, we explore how potentials for developing local identities were related to the ways in which the teacher and students formulated who can do and/or say what, to and with whom, when, where, under what conditions, for what purposes, and with what outcomes and consequences. By examining these questions, we explored community, personal, and academic positions and positionings constructed by members, and how these positions/positionings created identity potentials for both the collective and individuals-within-the-collective. Two questions guided our exploration of the construction of identity potentials: How did the teacher initiate locally constructed processes and practices that shaped what counted as students, teacher, and other collective, institutional and academic identities on the first morning of school? What evidence exists on the first morning and in end of the year essays that students took up the discursive patterns and practices of the classroom as material resources in (re)formulating local identities? By examining these questions, we explored how a fifth grade bilingual teacher and the linguistically diverse members of her class, collectively and individually formulated and negotiated situated definitions of what one was supposed to know and learn as well as what it meant to be a student, a mathematician, and a community member among other local identities.},

The relationship, however, differs significantly among instruments measuring achievement as well as among types of publication. Researchers using standardized achievement tests tend to report a relationship of significantly smaller magnitude than researchers using mathematics teachers' grades and researcher-made achievement tests. Published studies tend to indicate a significantly smaller magnitude of the relationship than unpublished studies.

Due to the ubiquitous use of mathematical software, this seemingly simple question is shown to lead to some subtle issues that are not usually addressed in the school curriculum. In particular, we present evidence that there exists much confusion regarding the connection between the algebraic and geometric aspects of slope, scale and angle. The confusion arises when some common but undeclared default assumptions, concerning the isomorphism between the algebraic and geometric systems, are undermined. The participants in the study were 11th-grade students, prospective and in-service secondary mathematics teachers, mathematics educators and mathematicians - a total of 124 people. All participants responded to a simple but non-standard task, concerning the behavior of slope under a non-homogeneous change of scale. Analysis of the responses reveals two main approaches, which we have termed 'analytic' and 'visual', as well as some combinations of the two.},

  abstract = {Complex systems are commonly found in natural and physical science. Understanding such systems is often difficult because they may be viewed from multiple perspectives and their analysis may conflict with or extend beyond the range of everyday experience. There are many complex structural, behavioral, and functional relations to understand as well. Design activities, which allow explorations of how systems work, can be an excellent way to help children acquire a deeper, more systemic understanding of such complex domains. We report on a design experiment in which 6th grade children learned about the human respiratory system by designing artificial lungs and building partial working models. Structure-behavior-function models are used as a framework for the cognitive analysis of the domain. The design activities helped students learn about the respiratory system. The design students indeed learned more than students receiving direct instruction. They learned to view the respiratory system more systemically. As expected, because of the short time they spent on the exercise, they understood more about structure than function and more about the functions of different parts of the respiratory system than its causal behaviors. This early Learning by Design experiment makes several important suggestions about successful learning from design activities: (a) the need to define design challenges functionally; (b) the importance of dynamic feedback; (c) the need for multiple iterations toward a solution; and most important; (d) thinking about design as a system of activities and allocating time so that the full system can be carried out, allowing its full set of affordances to be realized.},

In contrast to extant theories of individual interests, in which persistent engagement is pegged to a topic-specific relationship (e.g., a model rocketeer has an interest in the topic of rocketry, broadly conceived), I propose that persistence in a practice of interest is best understood in terms of what I call lines of practice. A line of practice is a distinctive, recurrent pattern of long-term engagement in a person's practice participation. Any line of practice entails a set of closely interrelated activities that are defined by two structural elements: preferences and conditions of practice. Preferences refer to the deep, long-term goals, values, and beliefs that a person develops in the practice, whereas conditions of practice refer to the constraints and affordances impinging on the person's practice (e.g., socioeconomic status and the norms of practice sites). A line of practice can thus be seen in the distinctive ways that a person's preferences are attuned, over the long haul, to specific conditions of practice, and how preferences cluster to form any single line. I show how persistent engagement can be understood in terms of the birth, death, and changes to a person's lines of practice and describe how this formulation broadens current theories of individual interests.},

The framework is applied in 2 studies, one of them featuring a class learning about negative numbers and the other focusing on 2 first graders learning about triangles and quadrilaterals. In both cases, the analysis of data is guided by questions about (a) features of the new mathematical discourse that set it apart from the mathematical discourse in which the students were conversant when the learning began; (b) students' and teachers' efforts toward the necessary discursive transformation; and (c) effects of the learning-teaching process, that is, the extent of discursive change actually resulting from these efforts. One of the claims corroborated by the findings is that school learning requires an active lead of an experienced interlocutor and needs to be fueled by a learning-teaching agreement between the interlocutor and the learners.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND

Innovation in design depends on successful concept generation. The ideation stage of design is intended to produce multiple, varied concepts from which to develop and choose. Often, instruction on idea generation methods is not offered in engineering classes; however, when taught, it is com- monly through techniques like brainstorming, which lacks specific ways to generate designs. Further, existing ideation strategies are not based on evidence from designers or rigorous testing through empirical studies.

PURPOSE

This study investigated how engineering students and practitioners generated ideas. We focused on how designers used product characteristics to define concepts, and how previous concepts were trans- formed into new solutions by modifying their characteristics. Our methodology is based on our pre- vious work identifying Design Heuristics in engineering solutions, defined as cognitive prompts that facilitate exploration of multiple designs during concept generation.

METHOD

Think-aloud recordings and concept sketches were collected from 36 engineering students and prac- titioners (with varying levels of experience) as they generated ideas for a novel design task in a labo- ratory setting. These data, along with retrospective interviews, were analyzed for the ideation strate- gies evident in the participants' solutions.

RESULTS

This study revealed evidence for over 60 strategies for concept generation during the ideation stage. Participants generated novel concepts and proposed concept modifications, and specific Design Heuristics were observed in their designs. The results suggest instruction on Design Heuristics can aid in effective idea generation.

CONCLUSIONS

This protocol study of engineering designers provides a collection of heuristics observed in practice that offers new methods for students and practitioners to explore design spaces. The Design Heuristics identified in this and previous work can potentially be learned and then incorporated into the practice of engineering students and practitioners.},

  abstract = {We report two studies involving an intelligent tutoring system for Lisp (the Carnegie Mellon University Lisp Tutor). In Experiment 1, we developed a model, based on production system theories of transfer and analogical problem solving, that accounts for effects of instructional examples, the transfer of cognitive skills across programming problems, and practice effects. In Experiment 2, we analyzed protocols collected from subjects as they processed instructional texts and examples before working with the Lisp Tutor and protocols collected after subjects solved each programming problem. The results suggest that the acquisition of cognitive skills is facilitated by high degrees of metacognition, which includes higher degrees of monitoring states of knowledge, more self-generated explanation goals and strategies, and greater attention to the instructional structure. Improvement in skill acquisition is also strongly related to the generation of explanations connecting the example material to the abstract terms introduced in the text, the generation of explanations that focus on the novel concepts, and spending more time in planning solutions to novel task components. We also found that self-explanation has diminishing returns. Finally, reflection on problem solutions that focus on understanding the abstractions underlying programs or that focus on understanding how programs work seems to be related to improved learning.},

This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

Introductory physics is one of the first courses in which students encounter multiple-step problems that require algebraic (rather than numeric) solutions, and this "reversal error" is relatively common in student solutions to these types of problems. We describe an investigation into three possible influences on students who make this reversal error: variable symbol choice, sentence structure, and context familiarity. Our results, from a calculus-based physics course and an intermediate algebra course, show that sentence structure is the most significant of these three possibilities. However, sentence structure alone does not provide a complete explanation for the reversal error.},

Although implementation was not perfect, these analyses suggest that shortcomings in implementation probably led to underestimates of the effects of class size. The analyses reported here suggest class size effects that are large enough to be important for educational policy and that are quite consistent across schools.

  abstract = {Modern text-based computer programming languages use syntax, semantics, and APIs to represent actions a computer will perform. Historically, the design of these languages has largely escaped the critical gaze of peer review, relying more on expert opinions than robust scientific methodologies. In this paper, we pose a question - is it possible to create a programming language where the syntax, semantics, and API design is based upon rigorous data collection and the scientific method? We have undertaken a long-term project to develop a computer programming language, called Hop, where each language decision is based upon empirical metrics gathered from human studies. While such a design may not universally benefit all programmers, our hope is that such a procedure may make our community's language design decisions more objective and transparent.},

This paper provides a critical commentary on the form of sociological explanation common to this approach. Viewed as a practical accomplishment, both theoretical statements and empirical case studies manipulate a boundary, making certain phenomena problematic while leaving others unproblematic. We call the main strategy for managing this boundary ontological gerrymandering. After applying this concept to both theoretical and empirical studies of social problems, we show that the same conceptual problems arise with respect to the labeling theory of deviance. We argue that investigation of the practical management of these problems will contribute to a deeper understanding both of social problems explanations and sociological explanation more generally.},

To determine the impact of these experiences on our students we have begun a cross-sectional and longitudinal study of their intellectual development based upon the Perry model. In this paper, we describe the research methodology and results for the initial group of first-year students interviewed. The results of the study include the effects on intellectual development of the first-year design course, gender, honors status, and the students' academic ability as indicated by SAT scores and grade point average. Design experience was positively related to enhanced intellectual development. Honors status, gender, and academic ability were not significantly related to Perry rating. We discuss the implications of these findings for instruction and curricular reform. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

  abstract = {There are many ways to understand the gap in science learning and achievement separating low-income, ethnic minority and linguistic minority children from more economically privileged students. In this article we offer our perspective. First, we discuss in broad strokes how the relationship between everyday and scientific knowledge and ways of knowing has been conceptualized in the field of science education research. We consider two dominant perspectives on this question, one which views the relationship as fundamentally discontinuous and the other which views it as fundamentally continuous. We locate our own work within the latter tradition and propose a framework for understanding the everyday sense-making practices of students from diverse communities as an intellectual resource in science learning and teaching. Two case studies follow in which we elaborate this point of view through analysis of Haitian American and Latino students' talk and activity as they work to understand metamorphosis and experimentation, respectively. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this new conceptualization for research on science learning and teaching. \dbend{} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

Findings show that sellers with little or no schooling develop in their practice a complex mathematics that contrasts sharply with school mathematics. Further, analyses reveal an interplay between what they learn in selling candy and what they learn at school: Sellers in school use their street mathematics to work school mathematics problems, and schooled sellers use some limited aspects of their school mathematics to solve problems in their practice.},

I start with a question about the costs and timescale of invention, comparing innovation in the classical music business (the ``power of inertia,'' as analyzed by Howard Becker) with processes underway in the classroom learning and teaching of statistics, which are offered by Rich Lehrer and Leona Schauble for secondary analysis in this volume. After a description of my own path through the corpus materials, I look across analyses in the target chapters that anchor this volume to build a synthetic account of the corpus as a case of what I call ``the discovery of invention.'' In this account, not only are children asked to invent data displays, but also the entire apparatus of teaching statistics for conceptual understanding is in the midst of invention. Just as it would be difficult to invent a truly novel way of authoring, performing, and hearing classical music, it has proven difficult to invent a novel way of teaching and learning mathematics (in this case statistics) in US public school classrooms. Reviewing the substantive and (in my view) complementary contributions of each target chapter, I argue that the difficulties of inventing a new way to teach mathematics are instructive and worth continued, collective effort.},

  volume = {84},
  abstract = {The thinking preferences of engineering students at the University of Toledo have been assessed in a longitudinal study, using the Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI). The scores and profiles reveal thinking preferences in four different ways of thinking and ``knowing'': A = analytical-logical-quantitative, B = sequential-organized-detailed, C = interpersonal-sensory-kines- thetic, and D = innovative-holistic-conceptual thinking. With the HBDI, we have a tool that can assess the effects of curriculum re- structuring. Data from 1990-1993 fall freshmen classes and 1991- 1994 spring senior classes have been evaluated, where the 1994 se- niors are the first group for which freshmen data are available. Conclusions drawn from the results are: 1) Overall, there has been a shift from ``plug-and-chug'' quadrant B thinking to increased ``creative'' quadrant D thinking, because more students with strong quadrant D preferences are being developed and retained, primarily due to the new creative problem solving course. 2) Avoidance of quadrant C thinking (teamwork skills) is persisting and creates classroom climates that are uncomfortable for some students, a high percentage being females. Students are not devel- oping the teamwork and interpersonal thinking skills demanded by industry. 3) A majority of students are still being cloned in the A-dominant profile of the faculty. Students who have developed independent ways of practicing right-brain thinking and all stu- dents who were involved in creative problem solving as class assis- tants became more whole-brained or right-brained. Quadrant C and D thinking activities must be integrated into the curriculum each term for students to develop their full potential and reinforce the whole-brain thinking skills introduced in the first-year creative problem solving course.},

  abstract = {The importance of both social processes and of representational aids for learning is well-established, yet few experimental studies have addressed the combination of these factors. The research reported in this article evaluates the influence of tools for constructing representations of evidential models on collaborative learning processes and outcomes. Pairs of participants worked with 1 of 3 representations (Graph, Matrix, Text) while investigating complex science and public health problems. Dependent measures included (a) the content of participants' utterances and representational actions and the timing of these utterances and actions with respect to the availability of information; (b) a multiple choice test of the ability to recall the data, hypotheses, and evidential relations explored; and (c) the contents of a written essay. The results show that representational notations can have significant effects on learners' interactions, and may differ in their influence on subsequent collaborative use of the knowledge being manipulated. For example, Graph and Matrix users elaborated on previously represented information more than Text users. Representation and discussion of evidential relations was quantitatively greatest for Matrix users as predicted, yet this came at the cost of excessive consideration and revision of unimportant relations. Graph users may have been more focused in their consideration of evidence, and the work done in the Graph representation had the greatest impact on the contents of the essays. Although limited to initial use of representations in a laboratory setting, the work demonstrates that representational guidance of collaborative learning is worthy of study and suggests several lines of further investigation.},

Principal components analysis on metacognition revealed that three metacognitive components (global metacognition, off-line metacognition, and attribution to effort) explained 66\% to 67\% of the common variance. The findings from these studies support the use of the assessment of off-line metacognition (essentially prediction and evaluation) to differentiate between average and above-average mathematical problem solvers and between students with a severe or moderate specific mathematics learning disability.

  abstract = {SummaryBackground
Trial findings show cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and graded exercise therapy (GET) can be effective treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome, but patients' organisations have reported that these treatments can be harmful and favour pacing and specialist health care. We aimed to assess effectiveness and safety of all four treatments.Methods
In our parallel-group randomised trial, patients meeting Oxford criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome were recruited from six secondary-care clinics in the UK and randomly allocated by computer-generated sequence to receive specialist medical care (SMC) alone or with adaptive pacing therapy (APT), CBT, or GET. Primary outcomes were fatigue (measured by Chalder fatigue questionnaire score) and physical function (measured by short form-36 subscale score) up to 52 weeks after randomisation, and safety was assessed primarily by recording all serious adverse events, including serious adverse reactions to trial treatments. Primary outcomes were rated by participants, who were necessarily unmasked to treatment assignment; the statistician was masked to treatment assignment for the analysis of primary outcomes. We used longitudinal regression models to compare SMC alone with other treatments, APT with CBT, and APT with GET. The final analysis included all participants for whom we had data for primary outcomes. This trial is registered at http://isrctn.org, number ISRCTN54285094.Findings
We recruited 641 eligible patients, of whom 160 were assigned to the APT group, 161 to the CBT group, 160 to the GET group, and 160 to the SMC-alone group. Compared with SMC alone, mean fatigue scores at 52 weeks were 3$\cdot$4 (95\% CI 1$\cdot$8 to 5$\cdot$0) points lower for CBT (p=0$\cdot$0001) and 3$\cdot$2 (1$\cdot$7 to 4$\cdot$8) points lower for GET (p=0$\cdot$0003), but did not differ for APT (0$\cdot$7 [-0$\cdot$9 to 2$\cdot$3] points lower; p=0$\cdot$38). Compared with SMC alone, mean physical function scores were 7$\cdot$1 (2$\cdot$0 to 12$\cdot$1) points higher for CBT (p=0$\cdot$0068) and 9$\cdot$4 (4$\cdot$4 to 14$\cdot$4) points higher for GET (p=0$\cdot$0005), but did not differ for APT (3$\cdot$4 [-1$\cdot$6 to 8$\cdot$4] points lower; p=0$\cdot$18). Compared with APT, CBT and GET were associated with less fatigue (CBT p=0$\cdot$0027; GET p=0$\cdot$0059) and better physical function (CBT p=0$\cdot$0002; GET p$<$0$\cdot$0001). Subgroup analysis of 427 participants meeting international criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome and 329 participants meeting London criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis yielded equivalent results. Serious adverse reactions were recorded in two (1\%) of 159 participants in the APT group, three (2\%) of 161 in the CBT group, two (1\%) of 160 in the GET group, and two (1\%) of 160 in the SMC-alone group.Interpretation
CBT and GET can safely be added to SMC to moderately improve outcomes for chronic fatigue syndrome, but APT is not an effective addition.Funding

This is not the case: Classical statistical testing is an anonymous hybrid of the competing and frequently contradictory approaches formulated by R. A. Fisher on the one hand, and Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson on the other. In particular, there is a widespread failure to appreciate the incompatibility of Fisher's evidential p value with the Type I error rate, a, of Neyman-Pearson statistical orthodoxy. The distinction between evidence (p's) and error ($\alpha$'s) is not trivial. Instead, it reflects the fundamental differences between Fisher's ideas on significance testing and inductive inference, and Neyman-Pearson's views on hypothesis testing and inductive behavior. The emphasis of the article is to expose this incompatibility, but we also briefly note a possible reconciliation.},

  abstract = {At present, most theories of human causal learning and inference slice up the world into a set of variables and the contingent relations among them. Most prominent among these theories is the causal Bayes nets framework. Many proponents of this theory argue that the strength of this model is demonstrated by its usefulness for learning from and interacting with the world. However, a careful consideration of what causal thinking does for us will lead us to discard the assumption that causal inference involves only contingency relations.
I make the case that we can perform the tasks of causal inference in ways that go beyond contingency- based models like Bayes nets. We also use representations of physical mechanisms, which allow us to make inferences that cannot be captured by contingency models. The results of six experiments demonstrate that we do form representations of physical structure and use those representations in causal reasoning.},

Because the prevailing genetic accounts of knowledge structures in mathematics education, cognitive science, and information-processing psychology do not explain key characteristics of the data, I begin to construct a new developmental account that does. To do so, I use forms, a class of schemata that combine patterns of algebra symbols with patterns of experience in the physical world, and 2 mechanisms, notation variation and mapping variation. I then use forms and the 2 mechanisms to analyze how the selected pair of students introduced and refined initial, faulty algebraic representations of the winch into an unconventional yet sound equation.},

A case study documents how one teacher's modes of working with technology changed over time and across different school contexts, and identifies relationships between a range of personal and contextual factors that influenced the development of his identity as a teacher. This analysis views teachers' learning as increasing participation in sociocultural practices, and uses Valsiner's concepts of the Zone of Proximal Development, Zone of Free Movement, and Zone of Promoted Action to offer a dynamic way of theorising teacher learning as identity formation.},

Jennings and Jacques Loeb, together with a positivistic approach to a philosophy of science, contributed to early efforts to explain behavior as a subject matter in its own right rather than as the effect of internal processes, mental or neural.

Three obstacles in its path as a science of behavior--humanistic psychology, the helping professions, and cognitive psychology--seem to explain why.

  abstract = {Of late, researchers in the area of homosexuality have emphasized the study of homosexual identity formation. Several models have been put forward depicting the process of identity acquisition, but little attempt has been made to test either their accuracy or generality. The study outlined in this paper assesses the validity of several important aspects of my six-stage model of homosexual identity acquisition. To this end, a questionnaire was constructed to measure a number of factors believed to be critical to homosexual identity development. Responses of subjects at each stage were examined to ascertain the degree to which they corresponded with ideal stage descriptions predicted from the model. Results provided some support for the validity of these descriptions and for the order of the stages. The data describe a four-stage, rather than a six-stage model. To check that these findings were not the result of researcher bias, a discriminant analysis was carried out. This indicated that the postulated six-stage groups could be distinguished. Ways of revising the scoring keys so as to maximize group differences are discussed. Both similarities and differences were apparent between male and female subjects, but the small sample limited the degree to which conclusions could be drawn about these. Implications of these findings for other models of homosexual identity formation are discussed.},

The second aim is to introduce an epistemological dimension to activity theory, specifically to the notions of boundary object and boundary crossing. We draw on ethnographic research in a pensions company and focus on data derived from detailed analysis of the diverse perspectives that exist with respect to one symbolic artifact, the annual pension statement. This statement is designed to facilitate boundary crossing between company and customers. Our study shows that the statement routinely failed in this communicative role, largely due to the invisible factors of the mathematical-financial models underlying the statement that are not made visible to customers or to the customer Enquiry Team whose task is to communicate with customers. By focusing on this artifact in boundary-crossing situations, we identify and elaborate the nature of the techno-mathematical knowledge required for effective communication between different communities in the pensions company, and suggest the implications of our findings for workplaces more generally.

From 2001-present an extensive battery of visualization software was developed for this course. Students consistently ranked the visualization software as more important to their learning than any other element of the course. However, these rankings were not highly correlated with actual outcomes. This study of learning style determined that reflective and verbal learners outperformed active and visual ones. Student opinions of the value of programming projects and lectures rank highest and seem to cut across learning style preference. Background familiarity with computers and software was not a strong correlate, although involvement in computer and video gaming was found to be negatively correlated with course success.},

A subgroup of subjects showed substantial procedural learning of the sequence in the absence of explicit declarative knowledge of it. Their ability to generate the sequence was effectively at chance and showed no savings in learning. Additional amounts of training increased both procedural and declarative knowledge of the sequence. Development of knowledge in one system seems not to depend on knowledge in the other. Procedural learning in this situation is neither solely perceptual nor solely motor. The learning shows minimal transfer to a situation employing the same motor sequence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserved)},

The study reported in this article draws on systems-of-practice theory to focus on the dynamic interplay among actors, artifacts, and tasks that constrains activities such as course planning and constitutes other activities, such as classroom instruction. This qualitative case study of faculty teaching in math and science disciplines at 3 research universities is based on interview and classroom observation data (n = 57 instructors) that are analyzed using causal network and social network analysis techniques. Results indicate that course syllabi are important organizational artifacts that are created by curriculum committees, inherited from previous instructors, and shaped by consideration of the sequential acquisition of knowledge. Faculty perceived that although course syllabi delimit the type and temporal sequencing of material for faculty, they are generally free to teach how they like. Observation data reveal discipline-specific configurations in frequently used teaching methods, cognitive engagements, and the use of instructional technology. These results also demonstrate that conceptualizing teaching solely as the use of particular methods (e.g., lecture) obscures subtle features of practice. Using the approach outlined in this article, instructional designers can obtain insights into meanings and practices that can be used to design and implement locally attuned reform initiatives.},

Such syntheses should present objective, clear, scientifically accurate, and defensible evidence in terms that educators can use in making their decisions. The syntheses should also give the most weight to research with strong causal validity and should consider sources of bias and use procedures that reduce or eliminate bias. To that end, it is hoped that theoretical development of standards will help researchers to assess the trade-offs that need to be made in weighing the evidence to be used in syntheses. Creating methods for assessing the extent of evidence in syntheses will enhance their usefulness in evidence-informed decision making.},

I propose a way to view conceptual domains using a metaphor of an environment in which one can know how to find resources and use them to make things. I discuss the domain of numbers and quantities as an example of a conceptual environment, and I interpret number sense as a set of capabilities for constructing and reasoning within mental models. This perspective provides reasons that support considering various aspects of number sense as features of students' general condition of knowing in the domain of numbers and quantities, rather than skills that should be given specific instruction. Some current trends in research about cognition and learning support this view of knowing in conceptual domains, including number sense.},

The principles are illustrated through examination of a variety of linguistic interactions.},

  abstract = {In the computer science community, there is considerable debate about the appropriate sequence for introducing object-oriented concepts to novice programmers. Research into novice programming has struggled to identify the critical aspects that would provide a consistently successful approach to teaching introductory object-oriented programming. Starting from the premise that the conceptions of a task determine the type of output from the task, assisting novice programmers to become aware of what the required output should be, may lay a foundation for improving learning. This study adopted a phenomenographic approach. Thirty one practitioners were interviewed about the ways in which they experience object-oriented programming and categories of description and critical aspects were identified. These critical aspects were then used to examine the spaces of learning provided in twenty introductory textbooks. The study uncovered critical aspects that related to the way that practitioners expressed their understanding of an object-oriented program and the influences on their approach to designing programs. The study of the textbooks revealed a large variability in the cover of these critical aspects.},

We discuss our experiences in developing a case-based prototype to support the work of document search and retrieval. We then describe our encounters with organizational politics at the firm in the context of a joint exploration of image analysis technologies in relation to the work of litigation support.

The author presents two case studies of such activities at the intermediate and secondary levels, in two different schools. The analysis draws on video records and classroom artifacts, and applies the theoretical framework of Figured Worlds to consider how students drew on their past experiences and on the structure of the classroom activities to understand the mathematics and the social justice issues. The analysis demonstrates how in one activity, the activity provided a familiar figured world to support learning about issues of wealth distribution. In the second activity, because of a lack of what are termed `intermediary' figured worlds, students were left to draw on only their own experiences and background knowledge, including stereotypes about poor neighborhoods.},

Experimental results show that the behavior in the Tic-Tac-Toe is determined by the directly available information in external and internal representations in terms of perceptual and cognitive biases, regardless of whether the biases are consistent with, inconsistent with, or irrelevant to the task. It is shown that external representations are not merely inputs and stimuli to the internal mind and that they have much more important functions than mere memory aids.

The analysis indicates that students, especially females, tend to hold multiple misconceptions, even after instruction.

Students tended to focus on the current in solving problems and to confuse terms, often assigning the properties of current to voltage and/or resistance.},

  abstract = {This article extends a framework for the study of culture-cognition relations to problems of historical research and diachronic analysis. As an illustrative case, we focus on mathematics in Oksapmin communities located in a remote highland area in central New Guinea. The Oksapmin, like their neighboring Mountain-Ok groups to the West, traditionally use a 27-body-part counting system for number, and there is no evidence that Oksapmin used arithmetic in prehistory. We present a coordinated analysis of shifts in functions of a word form based on field studies completed in 1978, 1980, and 2001. These shifts are related to changing collective practices of economic exchange in which arithmetical activities are increasingly important. The word form fu has changed from its use as an intensive quantifier that means "a complete group of plenty" to one that means double a numerical value. We show how the analytic framework affords a multilevel inquiry into genetic processes of change in the Oksapmin case and argue that the approach is useful for understanding the interplay between cultural and developmental processes in cognition more generally.

Relationships among the three theoretical models and between Logo programming and geometric understanding emerged from the summary analyses. SOLO learning cycles in which students achieve relating level responses to a task are more likely to result in relational understanding of the task when students are able to approach the task with at least a transition towards descriptive level thought. Success in Logo programming appears to be necessary but not sufficient for success with the geometric aspects of the tasks. The results suggest the possibility of constructing an integrated model of teaching and learning based on the three theoretical perspectives.},

In particular, a student's sense of belonging to the engineering community is critical to that path. The primary research questions were: 1) which students self-identify as engineers?; and 2) what are the key factors that relate to self-identification? To address these research questions, a cross-sectional study of all undergraduate engineering students at a medium sized, Midwestern private university was conducted in the spring of 2009. The majority of engineering students did self- identify as engineers, with educational progression, gender and future career plans all being significant attributes. The factors that students most frequently identified as being necessary to be considered an engineer were intangible in nature and included: making competent design decisions, working with others to share ideas and accepting responsibility. Students' self-identification as engineers can be linked to a sense of belonging to the engineering college, as well as organisational recognition.},

Continuity in the structure is possible if the inductive argumentation is based on process pattern generalization ( PPG ), but this is not the case if a generalization is made on the results. Moreover, the PPG favors the development of generic examples that support cognitive unity and structural continuity between the argumentation and proof.

When this research is applied to the design of museum exhibits and outreach material, it becomes clear that there is a tension between being scientifically correct and communicating effectively to a broad, diverse audience. In this paper we present a new approach to thinking about science learning in museums. Drawing on decades of research from the learning sciences, we argue that being ``wrong'' is an inescapable part of learning, and that not all simplifications are problematic. Instead, being ``wrong'' involves the gradual restructuring of many fine-grained intuitive or commonsense notions that persist throughout the learning process and play an essential role in scientific expertise. We discuss the implications of adopting this approach for museum design.},

  abstract = {Science education standards established by American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the National Research Council (NRC) urge less emphasis on memorizing scientific facts and more emphasis on students investigating the everyday world and developing deep understanding from their inquiries. These approaches to instruction challenge teachers and students, particularly urban students who often have additional challenges related to poverty. We report data on student learning spanning 3 years from a science education reform collaboration with the Detroit Public Schools. Data were collected from nearly 8,000 students who participated in inquiry-based and technology-infused curriculum units that were collaboratively developed by district personnel and staff from the University of Michigan as part of a larger, district-wide systemic reform effort in science education. The results show statistically significant increases on curriculum-based test scores for each year of participation. Moreover, the strength of the effects grew over the years, as evidenced by increasing effect size estimates across the years. The findings indicate that students who historically are low achievers in science can succeed in standards-based, inquiry science when curriculum is carefully developed and aligned with professional development and district policies. Additional longitudinal research on the development of student understanding over multiple inquiry projects, the progress of teacher enactment over time, and the effect of changes in the policy and administrative environment would further contribute to the intellectual and practical tools necessary to implement meaningful standards-based systemic reform in science. \dbend{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A working model for freshman engineering retention is needed. This paper proposes such a model based on Tinto's Interactionalist Theory. Emphasis in this model is placed on pre-college characteristics as predictors for student academic success and retention. Through a literature search of both engineering education and general empirical studies, a list of significant pre-college characteristics important for modeling freshman engineer- ing student success and retention was developed. Significant differences were found between the engineering education and general empirical studies. The final model is described in terms of a block diagram with an extension to statistical modeling. Tables of empirical studies that have included pre-college characteristics as predictors for student success and retention are included. An application using data from a University of Michigan study is discussed.},

Professionals closely integrate their mathematical symbology with physical meaning, resulting in a powerful and productive structure. But because of the way the cognitive system builds expertise through binding, experts may have difficulty in unpacking their well established knowledge in order to understand the difficulties novice students have in learning their subject. This is particularly evident in subjects in which the students are learning to use mathematics to which they have previously been exposed in math classes in complex new ways. In this paper, we propose that some of this unpacking can be facilitated by adopting ideas and methods developed in the field of cognitive semantics, a sub-branch of linguistics devoted to understanding how meaning is associated with language.},

  abstract = {This research presents a case study of two teachers' emphasis on students' academic identity as a means of facilitating their science literacy development. These cases support a theoretical position that deconstructs the notion of normative science literacy into its constitutive components: (a) being scientific and (b) appropriating its literate practices. Such a perspective views language as a substantive resource for academic identity construction. As such, we utilize a theoretical metaphor of ldquocontextual shiftingrdquo to underscore teachers' central role in facilitating student understanding of literate practices associated with school science. Through a cross-case analysis of two elementary science classrooms, we identified ways that students' academic identities were connected to their affiliation with specific scientific literate practices. Our findings reveal that the teachers in both research classrooms utilized teaching practices designed to afford students opportunities to develop academic identities commensurate with science learning. \dbend{} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Many students enter physics courses with highly intuitive conceptions of nonobservable phenomena such as heat and temperature. The conceptions of heat and temperature are usually poorly differentiated and heat is often confused with internal energy. This article focuses on one student's cognitive and affective changes which occurred during the Grade 11 topic of heat and temperature. The instruction used an inquiry approach coupled with concept substitution strategies aimed at restructuring alternative conceptions identified using pretests. A constructivist perspective drove both the teaching and research, and Ausubel's theory of meaningful learning augmented the interpretive framework. The qualitative data comprising transcripts of all classroom discussions, student portfolios containing all of each student's written work, and teacher/researcher observations and reflections were collected and interpreted to generate a case study for one student named Ken. Ken's initial conceptual framework was undifferentiated with respect to heat and temperature. The course activities and concomitant use of concept substitution helped him differentiate these concepts and integrate them in a more scientifically acceptable way. A degree of affective and epistemological change was also identified as the course progressed. In-depth examination of the student's prior, formative, and final conceptions showed that during this unit, the student progressively accepted greater responsibility for his learning, was willing to take cognitive risks, and became more critical and rigorous in both written and verbal problem solving. \textcopyright{} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

It argues that the continuing decline in numbers choosing to study science at the point of choice requires a research focus on students' attitudes to science if the nature of the problem is to be understood and remediated. Starting from a consideration of what is meant by attitudes to science, it considers the problems inherent to their measurement, what is known about students' attitudes towards science and the many factors of influence such as gender, teachers, curricula, cultural and other variables. The literature itself points to the crucial importance of gender and the quality of teaching. Given the importance of the latter we argue that there is a greater need for research to identify those aspects of science teaching that make school science engaging for pupils. In particular, a growing body of research on motivation offers important pointers to the kind of classroom environment and activities that might raise pupils' interest in studying school science and a focus for future research.},

In the second step, educational data mining is conducted using a combination of the text replay data and machine-distilled features of student interactions in order to produce an automated means of assessing the inquiry skill in question; this is referred to as a detector. Once this detector is appropriately validated, it can be applied to students' log files for auto-assessment and, in future, to drive scaffolding in real time. Furthermore, we present evidence that this detector developed in one scientific domain, Phase Change, can be used \textendash{} with no modification or re-training \textendash{} to effectively detect science inquiry skill in a second scientific domain, Density.},

First, the process of mapping the features of the source and target problems and the process of adapting the source solution procedure for use in solving the target problem were clearly distinguished: (a) Successful mapping was found to be insufficient for successful transfer and (b) adaptation was found to be a major source of transfer difficulty. Second, we obtained direct evidence that schema induction is a natural consequence of analogical transfer. The schema was found to co-exist with the problems from which it was induced, and both the schema and the individual problems facilitated later transfer. Third, for our multiple-solution problems, the relation between analogical transfer and solution accuracy was mediated by the degree of time pressure exerted for the test problems. Finally, mathematical expertise was a significant predictor of analogical transfer, but general analogical reasoning ability was not. The implications of the results for models of analogical transfer and for instruction were considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserved)},

Instead, I propose that we need generative ways for student teachers and teacher educators to reconsider their assumptions, understand the values and practices of families and cultures different from their own, and construct pedagogy that not only takes these into account in locally appropriate ways but also makes issues of diversity an explicit part of the curriculum.},

The principal claim is that much prior work has suffered from inexplicitnes and imprecision in terms of what constitutes a concept. Second, we introduce a theory of one particular type of concept. A coordination class is a systematic collection of strategies for reading a certain type of information out from the world. We identify both structural components and performance properties of coordination classes. Using this theory, we analyse protocol data from a student with respect to the difficult concept of force in Newtonian mechanics.},

An alternative, realist approach to causality is presented that supports the scientific legitimacy of using qualitative research for causal investigation, reframes the arguments for experimental methods in educational research, and can support a more productive collaboration between qualitative and quantitative researchers.},

Investigating analogical reasoning by scientists `live' at laboratory meetings (in vivo) we found that the types of analogies they use change with their goals. Unlike subjects in many cognitive `reminding' experiments, scientists frequently used structural similarities in their analogies, as opposed to superficial similarities. By subsequently using the in vitro approach, we found that the use of structural information was associated with being asked to generate analogies and with the use of complex scenarios. Similar results are obtained in other areas of reasoning such as hypothesis testing and causal reasoning.},

Although useful in one sense, pertaining to scientific understanding, in another, pertaining to the process of scientific thinking, the metaphor may be fundamentally misleading. Research is reviewed indicating that processes of scientific thinking differ significantly in children, lay adults, and scientists. Hence, it is the instruments of scientific thinking, not just the products, that undergo "strong restructuring" (S. Carey; see record 1987-08644-001). A framework for conceptualizing development of scientific thinking processes is proposed, centering on progressive differentiation and coordination of theory and evidence. This development is metacognitive, as well as strategic. It requires thinking about theories, rather than merely with them, and thinking about evidence, rather than merely being influenced by it, and, hence, reflects the attainment of control over the interaction of theories and evidence in one's own thinking.

in the zoom of a lens. Researchers focus on a specific part of a complex process whilst taking account of the other views

way. Thus in zooming out researchers address the practices and meanings within which students become school-mathematical actors,
whilst zooming in enables a study of mediation and of individual trajectories within the classroom. In each choice of object
of research the range of other settings have to be incorporated into the analysis. Such analyses aim to embrace the complexity
of the teaching-learning process. This article will present a cultural, discursive psychology for mathematics education that
takes language and discursive practices as central in that meanings precede us and we are constituted within language and
the associated practices, in the multiple settings within which we grow up and participate.},

We have recently created and are implementing threadstm, a new structuring principle for computing curricula. Threads provides one clear path for computer scientists seeking to reinvent and re-invigorate computer science degree programs. Threads form a cohesive, coordinated set of contexts for understanding computing. The union of all threads covers the breadth "computer science." The union of any two threads is sufficient to cover a computer science degree. In this paper, we describe Threads, our process, the impact so far, and some of our future plans.

  abstract = {SummaryBackground
The function of current artificial arms is limited by inadequate control methods. We developed a technique that used nerve transfers to muscle to develop new electromyogram control signals and nerve transfers to skin, to provide a pathway for cutaneous sensory feedback to the missing hand.
Methods
We did targeted reinnervation surgery on a woman with a left arm amputation at the humeral neck. The ulnar, median, musculocutaneous, and distal radial nerves were transferred to separate segments of her pectoral and serratus muscles. Two sensory nerves were cut and the distal ends were anastomosed to the ulnar and median nerves. After full recovery the patient was fit with a new prosthesis using the additional targeted muscle reinnervation sites. Functional testing was done and sensation in the reinnervated skin was quantified.
Findings
The patient described the control as intuitive; she thought about using her hand or elbow and the prosthesis responded appropriately. Functional testing showed substantial improvement: mean scores in the blocks and box test increased from 4$\cdot$0 (SD 1$\cdot$0) with the conventional prosthesis to 15$\cdot$6 (1$\cdot$5) with the new prosthesis. Assessment of Motor and Process Skills test scores increased from 0$\cdot$30 to 1$\cdot$98 for motor skills and from 0$\cdot$90 to 1$\cdot$98 for process skills. The denervated anterior chest skin was reinnervated by both the ulnar and median nerves; the patient felt that her hand was being touched when this chest skin was touched, with near-normal thresholds in all sensory modalities.
Interpretation
Targeted reinnervation improved prosthetic function and ease of use in this patient. Targeted sensory reinnervation provides a potential pathway for meaningful sensory feedback.},

We use methods from machine learning to discover patterns in the data and try to predict final exam grades. We begin with a set of exploratory experiments that use fully automated techniques to investigate how much students change their programming behavior throughout all assignments in the course. The results show that students' change in programming patterns is only weakly predictive of course performance. We subsequently hone in on 1 single assignment, trying to map students' learning process and trajectories and automatically identify productive and unproductive (sink) states within these trajectories. Results show that our process-based metric has better predictive power for final exams than the midterm grades. We conclude with recommendations about the use of such methods for assessment, real-time feedback, and course improvement.},

  abstract = {Promoting the ability to reason generatively about novel phenomena and problems students may encounter in their everyday lives is a major goal of science education. This goal proves to be a formidable challenge in domains, such as molecular genetics, for which the accumulated scientific understandings are daunting in both amount and complexity. To develop effective instruction that fosters generative reasoning we need to have a sound understanding of the types of knowledge in the domain that are critical for such reasoning. In this study I examined the ensemble of knowledge, both general and domain-specific, undergraduate students employed in reasoning about problems in genetics. I found that students initially formulate a solution in terms that are not domain specific and that serve as a frame-solution frame-that outlines and constrains a more specific and domain-appropriate explanation. This solution frame is then filled in with two powerful forms of domain-specific knowledge I term: domain-specific heuristics and domain-specific explanatory schemas. These knowledge forms embody understandings of central mechanisms and entities in molecular genetics. By invoking these domain-specific knowledge forms, students were able to reason about a variety of both familiar and novel genetics problems. I present a cognitive model that highlights the role of these powerful conceptual understandings in promoting generative reasoning in genetics.},

The experiments described in this paper support this idea: we found that learners who used our conceptual models were able to analyze and solve problems conceptually, while learners who used task-oriented learning materials of equivalent scope employed aimless trial and error.},

Our ethnographic analysis showed that, through students' participation in creating scientific papers on the physics of sound, their appropriation of scientific discourse was related to the framing activities of the teachers and the social practices established over time in the classroom. Our textual analysis of the student papers focused on how they used evidence to make claims.

enrich urban students' academic experiences and proficiencies. Such was the case in the study described by DeGennaro and Brown
in which urban students participated in an after-school technology course intended to address the ``digital divide'' by giving
these youth supported experiences as technology users. However, also like the initial situation described in this study, instructional
design that does not capitalize on what we know about urban education or informal learning contexts can actually further damage
urban youths' identities as learners by positioning them as powerless and passive recipients instead of meaningful contributors
to their own learning. The analysis presented in this forum is intended to further the conversation begun by DeGennaro and
Brown by explicitly complexifying our consideration of context (activity structures and setting) so as to support the development
of contexts that afford rich learning potential for both the urban students and their learning facilitators, positioned in
the role of teachers. Carefully constructed contexts can afford participants as learners (urban students and teachers) opportunities to access rich identity resources (not typically available in traditional school contexts) including,
but not limited to, the opportunity to exercise agency that allows participants to reorganize their learning context and enacted
culture as needed.},

To apply substitution commands to all files in a directory or throughout your project use the stream editor sed. The Perl and Ruby scripting languages also offer in-place substitution functionality through command-line invocation options, and their expression evaluators allow you to perform more sophisticated processing. Finally, you can easily change file names or move files around by using find to locate the corresponding files and sed to craft the text of a command that will accomplish the action you want. You can increase your effectiveness in this approach by building expressions incrementally, by tolerating silence and noise, and by writing consistent code.},

Firstly, students tend to learn programming by memorizing correct code examples instead of acquiring the programming thought process. Secondly, they tend to read code by "flying" over it at a comfortable altitude while thinking to its assumed intent. While relaxing, this practice fails to train students to develop the rigor to catch bugs in others' or their own code. Both trends result in an almost complete loss of intentionality in the programming activity; un-innovative code is generated by analogy with (or cut and paste from) existing solutions and is then almost randomly modified until "it fits" the minimal tests requirements without real analysis of its flaws. We review and evaluate pedagogical strategies which can be leveraged by instructors to address the above mentioned issues. Namely, we discuss the benefits of various forms of "Live coding" and test-driven pair programming active learning practices.},

  abstract = {Most research about women in engineering focuses on reasons for their under-representation. In contrast, we capitalized on an opportunity to study success: the School of Industrial Engineering at the University of Oklahoma had organically achieved parity of the sexes at the undergraduate level. To investigate this success, we adopted an ethnographic perspective, interviewing 185 students who represented four fields and four institutions as well as 12 faculty in Industrial Engineering at the University of Oklahoma. These data pointed to a combination of aspects of the discipline and the department culture as explanatory variables. Emerging from the data was a third explanatory variable: a high number of students, disproportionately many women, who relocated into Industrial Engineering from another major, underscoring the impact of broad recruiting activities. This paper emphasizes ideas that other departments can consider adapting to their own efforts to increase diversity. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Certain misunderstandings in science, mathematics, and computer programming display strong structural analogies with one another. Even within one of these domains, however, not all misunderstandings are structurally similar. To explain the commonality and variety, four levels of knowledge are posited: (a) content, (b) problem-solving, (c) epistemic, and (d) inquiry. Through analysis of several examples, it is argued that misunderstandings have causes at multiple levels, with highly domain-specific causes predominant at the "content" level and somewhat more general causes at the other levels. The authors note that education characteristically neglects all but the content level, describe successful interventions at all levels, and urge more attention in education to integration across the levels.},

This type of reasoning can be dissociated from reasoning based on descriptive knowledge in that it depends on different abilities and memory stores, is expressed more easily in gesture than in language, exhibits analog properties, and can result in correct inferences in situations where people do not have correct descriptive knowledge. Although it is frequently accompanied by imagery, mental simulation is not a process of inspecting a holistic visual image in the `mind's eye'. Mental simulations are constructed piecemeal, include representations of non-visible properties and can be used in conjunction with non-imagery processes, such as task decomposition and rule-based reasoning.

While the degree to which they participate and immediate benefits of participation have been explored, pathways by which participation in nonacademic ``outside'' communities leads to academic engagement are not as well understood. Purpose (Hypothesis) This study seeks to identify outside communities to which students feel most connected and pathways by which these important communities influence students' academic endeavors. Design/Method This study uses mixed methods, combining surveys and focus groups. A survey emphasizing measurement of belonging, engagement, and connection to community was collected from over 750 student participants at four different institutions. Focus groups were then used to explore how students' most important communities influence their academic life. Focus group data analysis revealed which needs were met for students through participation in outside communities. Results Across all institutions, family is the community to which students feel most connected, with friends being a distant second. Students spoke of communities strategically, identifying needs that they meet through participation in communities and linking their participation with increased ability to engage in their academic endeavors. Most frequently, students' belonging needs were met through participation in outside communities, although safety and esteem needs were also affected. Conclusions Our results strongly suggest that, among the many types of needs studied, providing students with opportunities to belong will provide the most return on investment for engagement in academic endeavors.},

More important, the results of these tests used as the criteria for identification and classification of ELL students, particularly those at the lower end of the English proficiency spectrum, may be misleading. Caution must be exercised when the results of these tests are used for special education eligibility, particularly in placing ELL students with lower English language proficiency in the learning/reading disability category.

Our argument requires analysis of specific instances in the literature, and so we have selected four prominent publications for consideration as examples. These, we show, pay little attention to the student reasoning they depict, presume traditional notions of ``content'' as correct information, and treat assessment as distinct from other activities of learning and teaching, even when they claim the contrary. We then offer an alternative image of formative assessment centered on attention to disciplinary substance, which we illustrate with an example from a high school biology class. Assessment, we contend, should be understood and presented as genuine engagement with ideas, continuous with the disciplinary practices science teaching should be working to cultivate. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Hammett's book of that title, although substantial earlier work can be traced back to the turn of the 20th century. Many of the instrumental tools that helped the discipline develop in so many different ways began to appear in the late thirties and during World War II and were soon built to be increasingly operated in the ``hands-on'' mode. This development became very popular in academia, where instruments are not operated for you by an expert, but even if you are an undergraduate, you can more or less be the expert yourself and take many varieties of data on instruments usually available on a 24 h basis. It has been my privilege and joy to begin research in chemistry just as these waves of change began to grow and to savor the great contribution that the new methods, such as measurement of 14C, UV-vis, IR, NMR, and hands-on use of computers, made in facilitating our research programs at MIT and later at Caltech. Among those programs, which will be discussed, were 14C tracing of carbocation rearrangements and benzyne formation, electrical effects of substituents, Grignard reagents, synthesis of small-ring compounds, (2 + 2) cycloaddition reactions of halogenated ethylenes, assisting in development of 19F, 13C, and 15N NMR for conformational analysis, other structural, kinetic, and tracer studies, as well as helping through textbooks to bring H{\"u}ckel MO theory and the elements of NMR to familiarity for organic chemists. From the very beginning of my research career, I have been the beneficiary of personal mentoring which has been very crucial to my success in research and is an important theme in what follows.},

Half of the adults read the text with "seductive details" (propositions presenting interesting, but unimportant, information), half without. After reading, the adults recalled the important information (a macroprocessing task), rated the text for overall interestingness, reported the single most interesting piece of information read, and matched pictures of animals on the basis of differences mentioned in text (a microprocessing task). The adults presented with seductive details in text were significantly less adept than their peers at including three main ideas in their recall protocols. Microprocessing performance and interestingness ratings were unaffected by text condition. In a second study, with 36 seventh graders, macroprocessing performance in general was weak. Students presented with seductive details in text were significantly less adept at macroprocessing than students given no such irrelevant information and given redundant signaling of the main ideas. Microprocessing success of seventh graders was also affected by the presence of seductive details. Results are examined in the context of current theories of expository text processing.

  abstract = {This study explores how students' physics identities are shaped by their experiences in high school physics classes and by their career outcome expectations. The theoretical framework focuses on physics identity and includes the dimensions of student performance, competence, recognition by others, and interest. Drawing data from the Persistence Research in Science and Engineering (PRiSE) project, which surveyed college English students nationally about their backgrounds, high school science experiences, and science attitudes, the study uses multiple regression to examine the responses of 3,829 students from 34 randomly selected US colleges/universities. Confirming the salience of the identity dimension for young persons' occupational plans, the measure for students' physics identity used in this study was found to strongly predict their intended choice of a physics career. Physics identity, in turn, was found to correlate positively with a desire for an intrinsically fulfilling career and negatively with a desire for personal/family time and opportunities to work with others. Physics identity was also positively predicted by several high school physics characteristics/experiences such as a focus on conceptual understanding, real-world/contextual connections, students answering questions or making comments, students teaching classmates, and having an encouraging teacher. Even though equally beneficial for both genders, females reported experiencing a conceptual focus and real-world/contextual connections less frequently. The explicit discussion of under-representation of women in science was positively related to physics identity for female students but had no impact for male students. Surprisingly, several experiences that were hypothesized to be important for females' physics identity were found to be non-significant including having female scientist guest speakers, discussion of women scientists' work, and the frequency of group work. This study exemplifies a useful theoretical framework based on identity, which can be employed to further examine persistence in science, and illustrates possible avenues for change in high school physics teaching. \textcopyright{} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this data corpus, experts tended to dominate interactions during group quizzes, whereas presentation preparations were more equitable, particularly when a student was positioned as a facilitator.

Throughout his 1st decade in the field, Piaget frequently discussed and justified the many different approaches to data collection he used. Analysis of his methodological progression during this period reveals that Piaget's determination to access the genuine convictions of children eventually led him to combine 3 distinct traditions in which he had been trained--naturalistic observation, psychometrics, and the psychiatric clinical examination. It was in this amalgam, first evident in his 4th text, that Piaget discovered the clinical dynamic that would drive the classic experiments for which he is most well known.

Three related hypotheses are evaluated regarding how affective and relational factors relate to the student's classroom experiences and career outlook. The first two hypotheses predict that positive (internal) affect and positive relationships with others will be highly correlated to positive experiences in the classroom.	The last hypotheses predicts that students who experience the classroom in a positive way will have a more positive career outlook.

  abstract = {Anderson, Reder, and Simon (1996) contested four propositions that they incorrectly called ``claims of situated learning.'' This response argues that the important differences between situative and cognitive perspectives are not addressed by discussion of these imputed claims. Instead, there are significant differences in the framing assumptions of the two perspectives. I clarify these differences by inferring questions to which Anderson et al.'s discussion provided answers, by identifying presuppositions of those questions made by Anderson et al., and by stating the different presuppositions and questions that I believe are consistent with the situative perspective. The evidence given by Anderson et al. is compatible with the framing assumptions of situativity; therefore, deciding between the perspectives will involve broader considerations than those presented in their article. These considerations include expectations about which framework offers the better prospect for developing a unified scientific account of activity considered from both social and individual points of view, and which framework supports research that will inform discussions of educational practice more productively. The cognitive perspective takes the theory of individual cognition as its basis and builds toward a broader theory by incrementally developing analyses of additional components that are considered as contexts. The situative perspective takes the theory of social and ecological interaction as its basis and builds toward a more comprehensive theory by developing increasingly detailed analyses of information structures in the contents of people's interactions. While I believe that the situative framework is more promising, the best strategy for the field is for both perspectives to be developed energetically.},

His argument is a response to suggestions (Hofer \& Pintrich, 1997; Sandoval, 2005) that the study of personal epistemology should focus on people's views about knowledge and knowing and not conflate those with views about learning. His main concern is that learners' views about knowledge and their views about learning may, in fact, be conflated and that an insistence on definitional clarity could lead to a mischaracterization of cognitive structures. In this response I argue that clarity in the definition of theoretical constructs does not imply exclusion of views about learning from the study of personal epistemology. Furthermore, given the history of this area of research, failing to more clearly define our constructs makes real theoretical progress difficult. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

It considers how we might take interest in situated worlds, and then turns to our common corpus of classroom materials to suggest how this alternate reading could take interest in them. Examining the same materials as our lead paper, it writes an analysis that is different in kind. On this account, ``situatedness'' cannot freely be joined to or supplement other analytic programs, if only because it owns its own program.},

These artifacts are useful in problem solving across boundaries. At the same time, authority over these objects can reinforce or redistribute task area boundaries, and by symbolizing the work of occupational groups, the objects also represent and strengthen beliefs about the legitimacy of a group's work.},

This working group investigated the programming competency students have as they complete their first one or two courses in computer science. In order to explore options for assessing students, the working group developed a trial assessment of whether students can program. The underlying goal of this work was to initiate dialog in the Computer Science community on how to develop these types of assessments. Several universities participated in our trial assessment and the disappointing results suggest that many students do not know how to program at the conclusion of their introductory courses. For a combined sample of 216 students from four universities, the average score was 22.89 out of 110 points on the general evaluation criteria developed for this study. From this trial assessment we developed a framework of expectations for first-year courses and suggestions for further work to develop more comprehensive assessments.},

Textbooks on methods themselves are the appropriate place for such practical guidance (e.g., Coffey \& Atkinson, 1996; Silverman, 1997, 2004).

Although no full solution of this paradox is in sight, it is argued that progress is possible through examination of the wide range of mental resources available to human learners, only a limited range of which are taken account of in current theories. This paper considers 10 relatively neglected resources for the "bootstrapping" of cognitive growth, including chance plus selection, the affective boosting of relevant schemas, the operation of innate biases, and use of spare mental capacity. Implications for educational research are illustrated with reference to recent work on the development of complex composition strategies.},

  abstract = {Structure, clearly understood and represented, is a key tool in the design of any complex artifact. Software systems are among the most complex of all human artifacts. The software designer's essential product is not the software itself, but the behaviours that it evokes in the `problem world' outside the computer and the affordances it provides to its users. The properties of the problem world, and the users' capacities to understand and exploit the system's complex functionality, are therefore vital subjects for the designer's attention. Causality is an important concern in a realistic system, within the computer, within the problem world, and in their mutual interactions. The computer can process and manipulate information; it can therefore embody useful representations of the problem world, of its users, and even of itself, adding further levels of structural complexity. This paper discusses some aspects of structure and its representation arising from these concerns in software system design, and offers some general observations relevant to other design fields. The discussion is illustrated by the design task studied in the SPSD, 2010 workshop that took place in February 2010 at UC Irvine, CA, USA.},

The students in the study reported that social interactions, variety, and meaning were central to positive learning experiences, yet dominant school practices they experienced were memorization, reproduction of procedures, and individualized work. It is argued that teaching and learning practices are central to the knowledge students learn and that those of traditional classrooms are sufficiently strange and other-worldly to create a limiting effect upon students' use of mathematics in non-classroom situations.},

Defined as a representational mapping from a known "source" domain into a novel "target" domain, analogy provides a basic mechanism for effectively connecting a reasoner's past and present experience. Using a four-component process model of analogical reasoning, this paper reviews sixteen computational studies of analogy. These studies are organized chronologically within broadly defined task domains of automated deduction, problem solving and planning, natural language comprehension, and machine learning. Drawing on these detailed reviews, a comparative analysis of diverse contributions to basic analogy processes identifies recurrent problems for studies of analogy and common approaches to their solution. The paper concludes by arguing that computational studies of analogy are in a state of adolescence: looking to more mature research areas in artificial intelligence for robust accounts of basic reasoning processes and drawing upon a long tradition of research in other disciplines.},

Given proposed affordances of the visual programming language, Scratch, I hypothesized that those students learning Scratch would demonstrate greater competence in interpreting loops and conditional statements and would have more positive attitudes towards programming. However, differences in performance between the two groups appeared only in the greater ability of the students that learned Scratch to interpret conditional statements. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that students that learned Logo had on average higher confidence in their ability to program and students were no more likely to plan to continue to program after the course or view the learning of topics as difficult if they learned Logo or Scratch.},

  title = {Students' Criteria for Representational Accuracy},
  abstract = {In prior work we
1
observed that, while designing representations, students employed an iterative
process of innovating, critiquing, selecting, refining, and combining representations. Prior work also
cataloged a rich set of ideas for representational innovation. This chapter focuses on the ability to judge
and critique the quality of representations. In a study of high school students' critical abilities, we
investigated three main hypotheses: (1) Students' ability to critique representations is rich and generative.
(2) Students' critical capabilities are, by and large, relatively reactive and inarticulate. (3) Students' critical
capabilities are design-linked; that is, competence does not appear equally in all contexts, but shines
particularly in the context of design. Data from our study support all these hypotheses, with qualifications.
Most unequivocally, students seem to have a strong, uninstructed, yet scientifically cogent competence to
judge the quality of representations.},

This paper presents our taxonomy of C P usage patterns and discusses our insights with examples drawn from our observations. From our insights, we propose a set of tools that both can reduce software maintenance problems incurred by C P and can better support the intents of commonly used C P scenarios.},

The Central Hypothesis of this work is that at least some forms of clinical interviewing are derivative of naturally occurring patterns of activity and interaction. As such, they do not warrant unnecessary a priori suspicion. More importantly, this view leads to avenues of empirical examination that allow determination and checking of the character of the clinical interaction, which bears directly on how and when data extracted in clinical contexts are scientifically valid.

The discussion, grounded in current research and theory relevant to representations of teaching, urban education, and mathematics teacher education, takes up three key issues: how is a focus on the urban context relevant to the design of video records of practice for mathematics teacher education? How can video records support prospective teachers' understandings of the sociopolitical contexts of mathematics teaching?

Identity theory is used as a theoretical lens to make sense of and better address some of the unique challenges of becoming a reform-minded science teacher, a professional identity that does not reflect the common norm in the profession; these challenges include the emotional risk and possible need for ldquorepair work,rdquo lack of familiarity with and buy-in into complex practices of inquiry, and the need for opportunities to participate in competent practice and have this participation acknowledged. Two basic design principles for science teacher preparation are identified as a result of this analysis: (a) the need to create safe places and scaffolded ways for beginning science teachers to try on and develop their identities as reform-minded science teachers, which may include capitalizing on the unique opportunities of practice teaching in out-of-school contexts; and (b) the need to offer opportunities to be recognized, by self and others, as reform-minded teachers through ongoing, structured, and supported reflection. \dbend{} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The paper examines how each pair resolved the requirements uncertainties, by treating different `users' differently. Our examination reveals how different approaches to the design exercise were actually organised to shed new light on software design practices.},

  abstract = {Records from the Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development indicate that engineering students are typical of students in other majors with respect to: persistence in major; persistence by gender and ethnicity; racial/ethnic distribution; and grade distribution. Data from the National Survey of Student Engagement show that this similarity extends to engagement outcomes including course challenge, faculty interaction, satisfaction with institution, and overall satisfaction. Engineering differs from other majors most notably by a dearth of female students and a low rate of migration into the major. Noting the similarity of students of engineering and other majors with respect to persistence and engagement, we propose that engagement is a precursor to persistence. We explore this hypothesis using data from the Academic Pathways Study of the Center for the Advancement of Engineering Education. Further exploration reveals that although persistence and engagement do not vary as much as expected by discipline, there is significant institutional variation, and we assert a need to address persistence and engagement at the institutional level and throughout higher education. Finally, our findings highlight the potential of making the study of engineering more attractive to qualified students. Our findings suggest that a two-pronged approach holds the greatest potential for increasing the number of students graduating with engineering degrees: identify programming that retains the students who come to college committed to an engineering major, and develop programming and policies that allow other students to migrate in. There is already considerable discourse on persistence, so our findings suggest that more research focus is needed on the pathways into engineering, including pathways from other majors.

  abstract = {In this study, we develop a model of science identity to make sense of the science experiences of 15 successful women of color over the course of their undergraduate and graduate studies in science and into science-related careers. In our view, science identity accounts both for how women make meaning of science experiences and how society structures possible meanings. Primary data included ethnographic interviews during students' undergraduate careers, follow-up interviews 6 years later, and ongoing member-checking. Our results highlight the importance of recognition by others for women in the three science identity trajectories: research scientist; altruistic scientist; and disrupted scientist. The women with research scientist identities were passionate about science and recognized themselves and were recognized by science faculty as science people. The women with altruistic scientist identities regarded science as a vehicle for altruism and created innovative meanings of ``science,'' ``recognition by others,'' and ``woman of color in science.'' The women with disrupted scientist identities sought, but did not often receive, recognition by meaningful scientific others. Although they were ultimately successful, their trajectories were more difficult because, in part, their bids for recognition were disrupted by the interaction with gendered, ethnic, and racial factors. This study clarifies theoretical conceptions of science identity, promotes a rethinking of recruitment and retention efforts, and illuminates various ways women of color experience, make meaning of, and negotiate the culture of science. \textcopyright{} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  title = {Why Early Courses Matter for Design-Focused Engineering Capstones},
  abstract = {Our work is a case study focused on design practice [1], [2] in undergraduate engineering. Treating design as inseparable from the work of engineering [3], we propose a trajectory for how some students develop and enact views of design practice. We analyze two distinct but thematically coherent streams of data, arguing that early course experiences can strongly color how students later come to treat design work. In one stream we follow ``Michael,'' a freshman engineering student at a large public university. Michael develops practical strategies to cope with an engineering program that (to him) undervalues mathematical sense-making and subjugates conceptual reasoning beneath calculation [4]. Our second data stream follows the activity patterns of a student team in a design capstone course at another large public university. For this team, there is a marked tension among its members between treating their task as a legitimate design project versus simply a schoolish exercise. Our analysis treats both streams\textemdash{}Michael and the design team\textemdash{}as bounding a single hybrid case [5]. By interpreting across time, location, and learning context we consider how the team data prefigure the trajectory of Michael, and how Michael's experiences explain the interactions in the design team [6].},

Of special interest is the notion of accessibility of examples: an individual's access to example spaces depends on conditions and is a valuable window on a deep, personal, situated structure. Through the notions of dimensions of possible variation and range of permissible change, we consider ways in which examples exemplify and how attention needs to be directed so as to emphasise examplehood (generality) rather than particularity of mathematical objects.

The device, called a winch, instantiates motions that can be modeled by pairs of simultaneous linear functions. The following question motivated the study: How can students generate algebraic models without direct instruction from more experienced others? The first mail result of the study is that students have and can use criteria for judging when 1 algebraic expression is better than another. Thus, students can use criteria to regulate their problem-solving activity. The second main result is that constructing knowledge for modeling with algebra can require students to coordinate criteria for algebraic representations with several other types of knowledge that I also identify in the article. These results contribute to research on students' algebraic modeling cognitive processes and knowledge structures for using mathematical representations, and the development of mathematical knowledge.

Working from an ecological account of perception-action, we propose that a methodology for understanding situated action should afford the instructional designer (often the classroom teacher), the methodologist, and the problem solver opportunities to co-construct coupling dynamics that operate on multiple space and time scales including "real time." With this goal in mind, we propose the use of the Jasper Planning Assistant (JPA), an online learning and assessment system that becomes part of the design-learning-research situation and serves as a scaffold for the learner. Through analysis of log-file data produced by the JPA, we illustrate that a methodology for situated action should be neither a purely quantitative nor qualitative account, but rather an inscription-an emergent visualization of the coupling dynamics between a student and his or her environment. We conclude that ideally this emergent inscription should reveal the multiple space times in which problem solving is occurring, yet be reductive in such a way as to create affordances for future action: Methodology should have functional value.},

It has now become possible to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to observe brain activity whilst students think about mathematics, although much of this work has concentrated on number. In this study, we used fMRI to examine brain activity whilst ten university students translated between graphical and algebraic formats of both linear and quadratic mathematical functions. Consistent with previous studies on the representation of number, this task elicited activity in the intra-parietal sulcus, as well as in the inferior frontal gyrus. We also analysed qualitative data on participants' introspection of strategies employed when reasoning about function. Expert participants focused more on key properties of functions when translating between formats than did novices. Implications for the teaching and learning of functions are discussed, including the relationship of function properties to difficulties in conversion from algebraic to graphical representation systems and vice versa, the desirability of teachers focusing attention on function properties, and the importance of integrating graphical and algebraic function instruction.},

Such films had long been of interest to him because they possess the peculiar property of appearing gold in color by reflected light, but green by transmitted light. Faraday hoped this behavior would model the general interaction of light and matter, perhaps extending his earlier finding that magnetic fields could affect a beam of polarized light passing through a highly refractive substance. In the course of this work, Faraday prepared over 600 microscope slides with thin metallic films adhering to them. Most of these epistemic artifacts have survived, as have his extensive diary records. Examination of this material permits reconstruction of his successive attempts to create a kind of dialogue with nature and provides evidence for his sophisticated ability to interactively create a microverse that could expand his mental microverse of field lines of force. While he failed to achieve his larger goals, the surviving specimens constitute a series of increasingly articulated representations of the structure of metallic matter. The case is thus one in which the ``model'' converges with the very thing intended to be modelled.},

In some cases reported in the literature, inappropriate statistical methods have been used, and statistical significance of results have not been addressed. In particular, asymptotic normality assumptions have often been used unjustifiably, leading to flawed results.This assumption of normal distribution limits the ability to analyze rare events. Unfortunately rare events do make up a large fraction of real text.However, more applicable methods based on likelihood ratio tests are available that yield good results with relatively small samples. These tests can be implemented efficiently, and have been used for the detection of composite terms and for the determination of domain-specific terms. In some cases, these measures perform much better than the methods previously used. In cases where traditional contingency table methods work well, the likelihood ratio tests described here are nearly identical.This paper describes the basis of a measure based on likelihood ratios that can be applied to the analysis of text.},

Moment-by-moment learning is calculated using a data-mined model which assesses the probability that a student learned a skill or concept at a specific time during learning (Baker, Goldstein, \& Heffernan, 2010, 2011). Two coders labeled data from students who used an intelligent tutoring system for college genetics, in terms of seven forms that the moment-by-moment learning curve can take. These labels are correlated to test data on the robustness of students' learning. We find that different visual forms are correlated with very different learning outcomes. This work suggests that analysis of moment-by-moment learning curves may be able to shed light on the implications of students' different patterns of learning over time.},

Participants in our study were 1,436 randomized chosen students of secondary schools from overall Finland. In the Finnish upper secondary school, there are two different syllabi for mathematics: the general and the advanced one. Schools were invited to organize the survey by one of their year 2 general syllabus courses and one of their year 2 advanced syllabus courses in grade 11. By means of factor analysis, we obtained seven dimensions in which students' hold beliefs and emotions about mathematics partly intertwined with their motivational orientations. These dimensions are described by reliable scales, which allow outlining an average image of Finnish students' views of themselves as learners of mathematics. Moreover, we analyzed relations between the seven dimensions and what kind of structure they generate. Thereby, a core of three high correlating dimensions could be identified, yielding different accentuations with regard to course choice.},

  doi = {10.1080/10749039.2012.688178},
  abstract = {In epistemologies of both scientific and common sense thinking ``objectification'' characterizes the formation of knowledge and concepts, yet in each case its meaning is different. In the former, objectification in acquiring knowledge refers to the individual's rationalistic reification of an object or of another person and to disengagement or alienation. Formation of concepts refers to the attainment of common features of persons, objects, or events. In the latter case, objectification is a dialogical process that takes place in daily activities and in communication. It rarely, if ever, pursues dispassionate ways but is judgmental and ethical. In this process, old myths, collective images, and historical narratives as well as habits of the mind, consciously and unconsciously present, refer to previous forms of knowledge and generate new ones. In this article, objectification in common sense thinking is discussed using an example of haemophilia in relation to HIV/AIDS. Haemophilia is a genetically transmitted disorder of blood clotting that has already been known as a family disease in Talmudic rulings in the second century. It seems that social representations of this disorder, which in its most common form affects male individuals because they inherit the defective gene from their mothers, evoke beliefs prevalent in various religions and mythologies. These beliefs and the lack of scientific knowledge about haemophilia have led, throughout history, to a wide spectrum of psychological and behavioural challenges with respect to patients, carriers, their relatives, and the general public. The nature of these challenges is not stable: They undergo alterations with technological advances in diagnosis and treatment as well as with changes in the understanding of medical complications including HIV/AIDS.},

In many human endeavors, however, the outcomes of interest are not determined entirely by the information processing properties of individuals. Nor can they be inferred from the properties of the individual agents, alone, no matter how detailed the knowledge of the properties of those individuals may be. In commercial aviation, for example, the successful completion of a flight is produced by a system that typically includes two or more pilots interacting with each other and with a suite of technological devices. This article presents a theoretical framework that takes a distributed, socio-technical system rather than an individual mind as its primary unit of analysis. This framework is explicitly cognitive in that it is concerned with how information is represented and how representations are transformed and propagated in the performance of tasks. An analysis of a memory task in the cockpit of a commercial airliner shows how the cognitive properties of such distributed systems can differ radically from the cognitive properties of the individuals who inhabit them.},

  abstract = {This article develops a situative approach to explaining the transfer of learning, illustrating it using a challenging-to-explain case from a Fostering Communities of Learners classroom. The case involved a group of 5th graders who learned and then transferred a more sophisticated way of explaining species survival and endangerment despite participating in a unit in which many activities designed to foster transfer were short circuited. The explanation included 2 kinds of analyses: (a) how students participated in the learning of relevant content, and (b) how learning contexts were framed interactionally. The content analysis took a situative perspective on commonly investigated transfer mechanisms such as quality of initial learning, engagement with multiple examples, comparison between examples, and formation of generalizations. There was strong evidence for a few of these mechanisms and weak or inconclusive evidence for others. The context analysis explored 2 aspects of the relatively new hypothesis that transfer is more likely to occur when learning contexts are framed as part of a larger ongoing intellectual conversation in which students are actively involved. First, the analysis showed that the teacher worked to frame learning contexts as being temporally connected with other contexts in which the students could use what they were learning. Second, it showed that the teacher worked to frame the students as contributing members of a larger community of people interested in what they were learning about. These and other forms of framing may have encouraged the students to expect that they would be generatively using what they were learning, thus leading them to make better use of the content-based supports for transfer that were available. Thus, this study suggests that coordinating analyses of content with the framing of contexts may be a particularly fruitful approach for developing more comprehensive explanations of how and why the transfer of learning occurs.

However, this research has yet to document the roles played by intuitive physics knowledge in expert physics practice. In this article, I discuss three related questions: (1) What role, if any, does intuitive knowledge play in physics problem solving? (2) How does intuitive physics knowledge change in order to play that role, if at all? (3) When and how do these changes typically occur? In answer to these questions, I attempt to show that intuitive physics knowledge can play a variety of roles in expert problem solving, including some roles that are central and directly connected to equations. This research draws on observations of college students working in pairs to solve physics problems. \textcopyright{} 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 43: 535\textendash{}555, 2006},

  title = {Assessing Fundamental Introductory Computing Concept Knowledge in a Language Independent Manner},
  abstract = {Measuring student learning is fundamental to any educational endeavor. A primary goal of many computer science education projects is to determine the extent to which a given instructional intervention has had an impact on student learning. However, the field of computing lacks valid and reliable assessment instruments for pedagogical or research purposes. Without such valid assessments, it is difficult to accurately measure student learning or establish a relationship between the instructional setting and learning outcomes. The goal of assessment research in computer science is to have valid ways of measuring student conceptions of fundamental topics, which will enable both research into how understanding of knowledge in the domain develops as well as enable curricular innovation and reform grounded in this knowledge.                 My dissertation work focused on three questions regarding assessment of introductory concepts in computer science. How can existing test development methods be applied and adapted to create a valid assessment instrument for CS1 conceptual knowledge? To what extent can pseudo-code be used as the mechanism for achieving programming language independence in an assessment instrument? And to what extent does the language independent instrument provide a valid measure of CS1 conceptual knowledge?                 I developed the Foundational CS1 (FCS1) Assessment instrument, the first assessment instrument for introductory computer science concepts that is applicable across a variety of current pedagogies and programming languages. I applied methods from educational and psychological test development, adapting them as necessary to fit the disciplinary context. I conducted think aloud interviews and a large scale empirical study to demonstrate that pseudo-code was an appropriate mechanism for achieving programming language independence. Student participants were able to read and reason in the pseudo-code syntax without difficulty and were able to transfer conceptual knowledge from their CS1 programming language to pseudo-code. Finally, I established the validity of the assessment using a multi-faceted argument, combining interview data, statistical analysis of results on the assessment, and exam scores.                 The contributions of this research are: (1) An example of how to bootstrap the process for developing the first assessment instrument for a disciplinary specific design-based field. (2) Identification that although it may not be possible to correlate scores between computer science exams created with different measurement goals, the validity claims of the individual assessments are not diminished. (3) A demonstration that novice computing students, at an appropriate level of development, can transfer their understanding of fundamental concepts to pseudo-code notation. (4) A valid assessment of introductory computing concepts for procedurally-based introductory computing courses taught in Java, Matlab, or Python at the university level.},

In our study of first-year students at the Ateneo de Manila University, we discovered that format strings present a substantial challenge for novice programmers. Focusing on their first laboratory we found that 8\% of all the compilation errors and 100\% of the exceptional, run-time behaviour they encountered were due to the improper construction of format strings. Format strings are a language unto themselves embedded within Java, and they are difficult for novice programmers to master when learning to program. In this article, we present exemplars of students' problematic interactions with the Java compiler and run-time environment when dealing with format strings, discuss these interactions, and recommend possible instructional interventions based on our observations.

The emerging third generation of activity theory takes two interacting activity systems as its minimal unit of analysis, inviting us to focus research efforts on the challenges and possibilities of inter-organizational learning. Activity theory and its concept of expansive learning are examined with the help of four questions: 1. Who are the subjects of learning? 2. Why do they learn? 3. What do they learn? 4. How do they learn? Five central principles of activity theory are presented, namely activity system as unit of analysis, multi-voicedness of activity, historicity of activity, contradictions as driving force of change in activity, and expansive cycles as possible form of transformation in activity. Together the four questions and five principles form a matrix which is used to present a study of expansive learning in a hospital setting in Finland. In conclusion, implications of the framework for our understanding of the increasingly important horizontal dimension of learning are discussed.},

A problem is 'doable' when scientists can align tasks to three levels of work organization - experiment, laboratory, and social world. Articulation is the planning and coordination needed to align levels. The framework is used to analyze data from a study of basic cancer research. Its usefulness is illustrated by a case study of oncogenic antibody research in a biotechnology company. The paper discusses the role of modularity and standardized packages of tasks in facilitating 'doability'. The findings suggest that attention to articulation work in the training and work processes of scientists, and to the conditions affecting alignment of levels of work organization, is necessary if doable problems are to be constructed.},

Concrete problem situations were powerful elicitors of oral computation procedures, whereas computation exercises tended to elicit school-learned computation algorithms. Oral computation procedures involved the use of two reliably identifiable routines, decomposition and repeated grouping, that revealed the children's solid understanding of the decimal system. In general, the children were far more successful in using oral mathematics than written mathematics. An understanding of children's oral procedures may be useful in developing more successful programs for elementary mathematics instruction.},

Software analyses illuminate the advantages of the latter approach for new visions of the potential cognitive benefits of computers. A new result emerges: Because the cognitive technologies we invent serve as instruments of cultural redefinition (shaping who we are by changing, not just amplifying, what we do), defining educational values becomes a foreground issue. The demands of an information society make an explicit emphasis on general cognitive skills a priority. The urgency of updating education's goals and methods recommends an activist research paradigm: to simultaneously create and study changes in processes and outcomes of human learning with new cognitive and educational tools.},

In this article, I examine self-explanation as a private case of the classical learning paradox, which is associated with self-referential activity, and consider an activity oriented solution to this difficulty. From a practical perspective, I suggest a reframing of self-reference in Activity Theory in order to provide researchers with a method for analyzing and supporting bootstrapping phenomena, such as the self-explanation effect, in learning and problem solving.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this article is to move readers toward a deeper understanding of and widened respect for autoethnography's capacity as an empirical endeavor. An argument is presented in favor of autoethnography as empirical by translating information from its epistemological and methodological history across the AERA standards for reporting empirical social science research. Supporting evidence is drawn from samples of autoethnographic scholarship that emerged from an extensive literature review of first-tier, blind peer-reviewed journals with relatively low acceptance rates (i.e., 17\% or less accepted for publication) that cater to an international audience of educational researchers. The journals include Harvard Educational Review, Anthropology and Education Quarterly, Teaching and Teacher Education, Qualitative Inquiry, Urban Review, Educational Studies, Journal of Latinos and Education, and Race, Ethnicity, and Education. The article concludes by imagining a rubric that may assist researchers, editors, and reviewers in translating autoethnographic scholarship as credible and defensible empirical research. To date, no such article has worked to demonstrate this important connection to open the potential empirical publication venues for autoethnography in our real world of promotion and tenure decision making in the academy that hinges increasingly on the integrity of the blind peer-review process.},

Learning has been measured, credentialed, bought, and sold to the point that educational reformers have to worry about the use and misuse of their most important product. They have to worry about the connections learning makes to persistent structural inequalities. Learning has been commodified, and efforts to reform learning instruction must be sensitive not just to the gentle facts of how it is best done by people working together, but to the more disturbing facts of how it can be isolated, tested, administered, fetishized, and put up for sale in the reproduction of career and income lines. Serious advances in learning theory must be protected from the possibility that they can be used to make things worse.},

The main focus of this work is to capture the entire analysis process that an analyst goes through from a raw data set to the insights sought from the data. The study provides interesting observations about the use of visual representations and interaction mechanisms provided by the tools, and also about the process of insight generation in general. This deepens our understanding of visual analytics, guides visualization developers in creating more effective visualization tools in terms of user requirements, and guides evaluators in designing future studies that are more representative of insights sought by users from their data sets.},

  abstract = {In this study I investigated how collaborative interactions influence problem-solving outcomes. Conversations of twelve 6th-grade triads were analyzed utilizing quantitative and qualitative methods. Neither prior achievement of group members nor the generation of correct ideas for solution could account for between-triad differences in problem-solving outcomes. Instead, both characteristics of proposals and partner responsiveness were important correlates of the uptake and documentation of correct ideas by the group. Less successful groups ignored or rejected correct proposals, whereas more successful groups discussed or accepted them. Conversations in less successful groups were relatively incoherent as measured by the extent that proposals for solutions in these groups were connected with preceding discussions. Performance differences observed in triads extended to subsequent problem-solving sessions during which all students solved the same kinds of problems independently. These findings suggest that the quality of interaction had implications for learning. Case study descriptions illustrate the interweaving of social and cognitive factors involved in establishing a joint problem-solving space. A dual-space model of what collaboration requires of participants is described to clarify how the content of the problem and the relational context are interdependent aspects of the collaborative situation. How participants manage these interacting spaces is critical to the outcome of their work and helps account for variability in collaborative outcomes. Directions for future research that may help teachers, students, and designers of educational environments learn to see and foster productive interactional practices are proposed.},

Many students, particularly those with low water-level scores, experienced difficulty on both field and laboratory tasks and failed to use good field-observation strategies.

However, other commentators suggest that the available data supports the view that children's thinking is inconsistent, with elicited notions being piecemeal, ad hoc and deeply situated in specific contexts. This is considered to reflect the fragmentary and unscientific nature of the learner's knowledge. Accumulating evidence from in-depth work with individual learners is beginning to show that models of cognitive structure that can usefully inform teaching may need to be more complex than either of these views admit. Evidence from a case study is presented to show how a learner may simultaneously hold several alternative explanatory schemes, each of which is persistent over time and applied coherently across a wide range of overlapping contexts. It is argued that the manifold nature of learners' conceptions may be a key to modelling conceptual development.},

  shorttitle = {Plans and {{Situated Actions}}},
  abstract = {This dissertation examines two alternative views of purposeful action and shared understanding. The first, adopted by researchers in Cognitive Science, views the organization and significance of action as derived from plans, which are prerequisite to and prescribe action at whatever level of detail one might imagine. Mutual intelligibility on this view is a matter of the recognizability of plans, due to common conventions for the expression of intent, and common knowledge about typical situations and appropriate actions. The second view, drawn from recent work in social science, treats plans as derivative from situated action. Situated action as such comprises necessarily ad hoc responses to the actions of others and to the contingencies of particular situations. Rather than depend upon the reliable recognition of intent, successful interaction consists in the collaborative production of intelligibility through mutual access to situation resources, and through the detection, repair or exploitation of differences in understanding.
Researchers interested in machine intelligence attempt to remedy the inherent vagueness of plans, to make them the basis for computational artifacts intended to embody intelligent behavior, including the ability to interact with their human users. I examine that project through a case study of people using a machine designed on the planning model, and intended to be intelligent and interactive. A conversation analysis of "interactions" between users and the machine reveals that the machine's insensitivity to particular circumstances is a central design resource, and a fundamental limitation. I conclude that problems in Cognitive Science's theorizing about purposeful action as a basis for machine intelligence are due to the project of substituting plans for actions, and representations of the situation of action, for action's actual circumstances.},

We briefly present their theory and test instrument. We have repeated their test in our local context in order to verify and perhaps generalise their findings, but we could not show that the test predicts students' success in our introductory program-ming course. Based on this failure of the test instrument, we discuss various explanations for our differing results and suggest a research method from which it may be possible to generalise local results in this area. Furthermore, we discuss and criticize Dehnadi and Bornat's programming aptitude test and devise alternative test instruments.},

  title = {Real-Time Programming and the {{Big Ideas}} of Computational Literacy},
  abstract = {Though notoriously difficult, real-time programming offers children a rich new set of applications, and the opportunity to engage bodily knowledge and experience more centrally in intellectual enterprises. Moreover, the seemingly specialized problems of real-time programming can be seen as keys to longstanding difficulties of programming in general. I report on a critical design inquiry, into the nature and potential of real-time programming by children. A cyclical process of design, prototyping and testing of computational environments has led to two design innovations: (1) a language in which declarative and procedural descriptions of computation are given equal status, and can subsume each other to arbitrary levels of nesting. (2) a "live text" environment, in which real-time display of, and intervention in, program execution are accomplished within the program text itself. Based on children's use of these tools, as well as comparative evidence from other media and domains, I argue that the coordination of discrete and continuous process should be considered a central Big Idea in programming and beyond. In addition, I offer the theoretical notion of the "steady frame" as a way to clarify the user interface requirements of real-time programming, and also to understand the role of programming in learning to construct dynamic models, theories, and representations. Implications for the role of programming in education and for the future of computational literacy are discussed.

This research has primarily studied students understanding of complex phenomena in science. However, complex phenomena are also pervasive in everyday life. Children observe and participate in them daily. How do they reason about such ordinary complex phenomena? In this study, we investigate students' reasoning about everyday complex phenomena. We report on interviews and a classroom participatory simulation with ten sixth-grade students about ordinary events that could be construed as emergent, such as social situations in which the social pattern emerges from the participating students' individual actions. We have observed a widespread student-initiated strategy for making sense of complex phenomena. We call this strategy "mid level construction," the formation of small groups of individuals. Students form these mid-level groups either by aggregating individuals or by subdividing the whole group. We describe and characterize this mid-level strategy and relate it to the students' expressed understanding of "complex systems" principles. The results are discussed with respect to (a) students' strengths in understanding everyday complex social systems; (b) the utility of mid-level groups in forming an understanding of complex systems; (c) agent-based and aggregate forms of reasoning about complex systems.

Despite anecdotal evidence that cognitive heuristics play a role in successful artifact reuse, few empirical studies have explored this relationship. This paper proposes how a cognitive heuristic, called anchoring, and the resulting adjustment bias can be adapted and extended to predict issues that might arise when developers reuse code and/or designs. The research proposes that anchoring and adjustment can be manifested in three ways: propagation of errors in reuse artifacts, failure to include requested functionality absent from reuse artifacts, and inclusion of unrequested functionality present in reuse artifacts. Results from two empirical studies are presented. The first study examines reuse of object classes in a programming task, using a combination of practicing programmers and students. The second study uses a database design task with student participants. Results from both studies indicate that anchoring occurs. Specifically, there is strong evidence that developers tend to use the extraneous functionality in the artifacts they are reusing and some evidence of anchoring to errors and omissions in reused artifacts. Implications of these findings for both practice and future research are explored.},

Abstract
Statistical models are the traditional choice to test scientific theories when observations, processes or boundary conditions are subject to stochasticity. Many important systems in ecology and biology, however, are difficult to capture with statistical models. Stochastic simulation models offer an alternative, but they were hitherto associated with a major disadvantage: their likelihood functions can usually not be calculated explicitly, and thus it is difficult to couple them to well-established statistical theory such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. A number of new methods, among them Approximate Bayesian Computing and Pattern-Oriented Modelling, bypass this limitation. These methods share three main principles: aggregation of simulated and observed data via summary statistics, likelihood approximation based on the summary statistics, and efficient sampling. We discuss principles as well as advantages and caveats of these methods, and demonstrate their potential for integrating stochastic simulation models into a unified framework for statistical modelling.},

It is argued that effective reasoning with ERs involves a three-way interaction between (a) the cognitive and semantic properties of the representation; (b) the match between the demands of the task and the type of information read-off afforded by the representation and (c) the effects of within-subject factors (e.g. prior knowledge, cognitive style). It is suggested that providing direct instruction in the use of ERs could usefully address each factor.},

Clancey's contribution to this volume: ``Transactional Perspective on the Practice-Based Science of Teaching and Learning.'' Because I agree strongly with what he says, there will be little criticism. I begin by examining the matrix of biological functioning from whence cognitive functioning emerges to make some comments about motivation before connecting the examination to the constructive character of Deweyan inquiry. We will find that for Dewey at least, mental functioning, like biological functioning, is never simply located in space or time. I also look at Dewey's functional, even organic, notion of tools as ``extra-organic'' organs. As functions, tools are not simply located either. This lack of simple location provides useful clues to the question of learning transfer. I also look at Dewey's circular notion of causation as a logical concept as well at his theory of intentionality and language before concluding with a discussion of Dewey's theory of emotions. All of these Deweyan ideas are brought to bear on Clancey's paper in hopes of creatively amplifying his fine analysis. If the reader finds my response less than creative, I nonetheless commend Clancey's paper to them for their own critical-creative response.},

  volume = {4},
  abstract = {Three experiments examined whether group cognitions generate a product that is not easily ascribed to the cognitions that similar individuals have working alone.  In each study, secondary school students solved novel problems either working as individuals or in two person groups called dyads. An examination of their problem-solving representations demonstrated that the dyads constructed abstractions well above the rate one would expect given a ``most competent member'' model of group performance applied to the empirical rate of individual abstractions. In the first experiment dyads induced a numerical parity rule for determining the motions of linked gears four times more often than individuals, who instead tended to rely exclusively on modeling the gears' physical behaviors. In a second experiment requiring the construction of visualizations on the topic of biological transmissions, dyads made abstract visualizations (e.g., directed graphs) significantly more often than individuals.  In a third experiment requiring a visualization of organisms and their habitat requirements, dyads made abstract visualizations (e.g., matrices) five times more often than individuals, who instead tended to draw pictures. These results are striking because a long history of experimentation has found little evidence that group performances can match the performances of the most competent individuals, let alone exceed them.  The extremely high frequency of abstract representations among dyads suggests that the abstract representations emerged from collaborative cognitions not normally available to isolated individuals.  The results are interpreted to be a natural result of the collaborative task demand of creating a common ground. To facilitate discourse dyads negotiated a common representation that could serve as a touchstone for coordinating the members' different perspectives on the problem. Because the representation bridged multiple perspectives of the problem structure, it tended to be an abstraction.},

  abstract = {$<$p$>$$<$br/$>$A number of accounts of expert programming behavior have been advanced. These models of the programming activity have served to highlight the range of factors that are thought to underpin programming strategy. However, such accounts have tended to emphasize either the effects of the organization of the programmer's knowledge representation or the role played by features of the notation of the task language on the emergence, development, and support of particular forms of strategy. Such work has neglected to (a) provide an account of the way in which these factors might interact to determine programming strategy, and (b) shed light upon the nature of the development of particular strategies as programming skill increases.$<$br/$>$This article presents the results of an empirical analysis of the strategies employed by programmers of varying skill levels using different programming languages. The development of particular forms of strategy is hypothesized to be related both to the development of systematic asymmetries in programmers' generic plan-based representations of programming knowledge and to the way in which features of the notation of particular programming languages might differentially support particular strategies. However, the results of the study reported here suggest that these effects must be interpreted within a broad developmental context. Hence, as programming skill develops, it appears that the notation of the task language tends to take precedence as a determinant of strategy, but has less relevance at beginning stages of skill development and within the context of expert performance. This finding would not be predicted by current models of the programming activity because such models suggest that any notational effects will tend to be consistent regardless of the skill level attained by the programmer. This article endeavors to extend current models of programming by emphasizing the need to consider in detail not only the development of programming strategy, but also the way in which knowledge representation and features of the task langauge interact to give rise to particular forms of programming behavior.$<$/p$>$},

  abstract = {An ongoing challenge for information visualization is how to deal with over-plotting forced by ties or the relatively limited visual field of display devices. A popular solution is to represent local data density with area (bubble plots, treemaps), color(heatmaps), or aggregation (histograms, kernel densities, pixel displays). All of these methods have at least one of three deficiencies:1) magnitude judgments are biased because area and color have convex downward perceptual functions, 2) area, hue, and brightnesshave relatively restricted ranges of perceptual intensity compared to length representations, and/or 3) it is difficult to brush or link toindividual cases when viewing aggregations. In this paper, we introduce a new technique for visualizing and interacting with datasets that preserves density information by stacking overlapping cases. The overlapping data can be points or lines or other geometric elements, depending on the type of plot. We show real-dataset applications of this stacking paradigm and compare them to other techniques that deal with over-plotting in high-dimensional displays.},

  abstract = {A survey of pre/post-test data using the Halloun\textendash{}Hestenes Mechanics Diagnostic test or more recent Force Concept Inventory is reported for 62 introductory physics courses enrolling a total number of students N=6542. A consistent analysis over diverse student populations in high schools, colleges, and universities is obtained if a rough measure of the average effectiveness of a course in promoting conceptual understanding is taken to be the average normalized gain 〈g〉. The latter is defined as the ratio of the actual average gain (\%〈 post 〉-\%〈 pre 〉) to the maximum possible average gain (100-\%〈 pre 〉). Fourteen ``traditional'' (T) courses (N=2084) which made little or no use of interactive-engagement (IE) methods achieved an average gain 〈g〉 T- ave =0.23$\pm$0.04 (std dev) . In sharp contrast, 48 courses (N=4458) which made substantial use of IE methods achieved an average gain 〈g〉 IE-ave =0.48$\pm$0.14 (std dev) , almost two standard deviations of 〈g〉 IE-ave above that of the traditional courses. Results for 30 (N=3259) of the above 62 courses on the problem-solving Mechanics Baseline test of Hestenes\textendash{}Wells imply that IE strategies enhance problem-solving ability. The conceptual and problem-solving test results strongly suggest that the classroom use of IE methods can increase mechanics-course effectiveness well beyond that obtained in traditional practice.},

The research aims to investigate the students' world, and hence, we have chosen a phenomenographic approach. Our questions focus on the students' experiences of concepts related to a realistic programming task in an extensive software system, particularly the Java Interface. The results show that there is a distinct variation of descriptions spanning from a concrete to-do list to a more advanced description where the interface plays a crucial role in order to produce dynamic and adaptive systems. We interpret the results and suggest how they can be used in teaching to provide an extended and varied understanding of how to work with advanced software. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

  abstract = {Two important questions regarding automated submission and testing systems are: What kind of feedback should we give students as they work on their programming assignments, and how can we study in more detail the programming assignment development process of novices? To address the issue of feedback, Marmoset provides students with limited access to the results of the instructor's private test cases using a novel token-based incentive system. This both encourages students to start their work early, and to think critically about their work. In addition, because students submit their work early, instructors and TAs can monitor all students' progress on test cases. This allows instructors to identify challenging test cases early and either update the project specification or spend additional time in lecture or lab sessions covering difficult material. To study and better understand the development process of students, Marmoset can be configured to transparently capture snapshots to a central repository every-time students save their files. These detailed development histories offer a unique, detailed perspective of each student's progress on a programming assignment, from the first line of code written and saved all the way through the final edit before the final submission. This type of data has proven extremely valuable for various uses, from mining new bug patterns to evaluating existing bug-finding tools. In this paper, we describe our initial experiences using Marmoset in several introductory computer science courses, from the perspectives of both instructors and students. We also describe some initial research results from analyzing the student snapshot database.},

Differences were explored between students' initial beliefs about statistics knowledge and their specific beliefs about conceptual knowledge and procedural knowledge in statistics. Results revealed differences across these contexts; students' beliefs differed between procedural versus conceptual knowledge. Moreover, students' initial beliefs about statistics knowledge were more similar to their beliefs about conceptual knowledge rather than procedural knowledge. Finally, regression analyses revealed that students' beliefs about the justification of knowledge, attainability of truth and source of knowledge were significant predictors of examination performance, depending on the examination. These results have important theoretical, methodological and pedagogical implications.},

The Arduino is more modern and has better technical capabilities, but there are fewer educational resources for the Arduino than there are for the Boe-Bot. The updated curriculum was successfully implemented at two universities. End-of-term surveys indicate that students had a positive experience of the course, especially the hands-on exercises. However, students were not as positive about the current state of instructional support for Arduino programming. The Arduino remains a viable and preferable platform. Recommendations for improvement of curricular materials for the Arduino are made.},

  title = {Disciplined Perception: {{Comparing}} the Development of Embodied Mathematical Practices in School and at Work},
  shorttitle = {Disciplined Perception},
  abstract = {This dissertation compares the working and learning practices in a middle-school mathematics classroom and a professional architecture firm. The comparative analysis is based upon ethnographic case studies of each setting. The primary data are representations of transcribed talk and embodied action assembled from a large corpus of audio-video recordings made in each setting. Both case studies are instances of socio-genetic analysis , documenting the development of teams of people working together on architectural design projects under very different organizational conditions. Focal attention in each case is given to how mathematical practices are and become practical resources for people. Drawing on cognitive, pragmatist, and interactionist research traditions, the core chapters develop an empirically grounded interpretative framework for understanding how cognition and learning occur "in the wild". Across the case studies, I argue that contexts for mathematical activity vary dynamically and routinely across local spaces, participant structures, and situations. In Chapter Two my case study of the classroom identifies two distinct contexts for mathematical activity, one corresponding to traditional school mathematics practices (the official mode) and another corresponding to mathematical practices that arise in design project work (the emergent mode). Through a comparison a team's activities in each mode, I seek to show how mathematics, individual competence, and collaboration appear distinctly different in the two modes. I show how the oscillation between these modes posed dilemmas for the teacher and students alike, and argue that this bimodality is general characteristic of contemporary project-based classrooms operating within the traditional organizational environment of a school. In Chapter Three I explore the mathematical activities involved in professional architectural project work, making a primary distinction between mathematical activities that were embodied in architects' routine tool-mediated work and mathematical activities that were distributed to other participants in project work, such as engineers. In general, I show that mathematical activities, while being ubiquitous in architectural work, were enacted in unfamiliar forms and served unfamiliar functions (from the perspective of what usually "counts as" mathematics) in architectural practice. In Chapter Four I offer an interpretative framework for understanding and comparing the cognitive activities of the students and the architects at an interactional level. This framework-- disciplined perception --treats disciplinary knowledge in terms of what people do across the coordinated modalities of talk, gesture, and inscription. This framework is offered as an alternative to traditional mentalistic conceptions of knowledge. My comparative analyses identify similarities and differences in the form, content, and function of disciplined perception across the cases. In Chapter Five I compare the classroom and the architecture firm from an organizational perspective, arguing that the classroom was a comparatively lousy place to learn and work for the students. Reasons for this comparative deficit include: an inadequate infrastructure for project work, limited access to consequential interactional resources, and an assessment system from which students could learn very little. The comparison with the organizational environment of the architecture firm is therefore a benchmark for exploring the conditions that make learning and meaningful work possible. In the concluding chapter I describe how these comparative case studies provide a new perspective on issues of cognition and development as well as furnishing productive resources for innovators seeking to improve discipline-based education.},

Principled practical knowledge (PPK) is a type of knowledge that has characteristics of both practical know-how and scientific theory. Like basic scientific theory, PPK meets standards of explanatory coherence. However, its main function is not explanation or prediction but practical guidance. PPK grows out of efforts to solve practical problems, but it requires additional effort invested in producing knowledge that goes beyond what is required for the task at hand yet not so far beyond as to be unusable by practitioners. The Wright brothers' construction of PPK to address problems of flight control is used as a model for building such knowledge in the learning sciences. Design-based research in the learning sciences may motivate research into basic theoretical questions, but it is unlikely to contribute directly to answering them. Extending design-based research to the creation of PPK can, however, increase the generalizability of knowledge produced through design work and provide a ladder leading to sometimes radical design improvement.},

Models highlight relevant details for a certain purpose, whereas irrelevant ones are hidden. Models are supposed to make system comprehension easier by reducing complexity. Therefore, models should play a key role in education, since they would ease the students' learning process. Although these statements are widely accepted, to the best of our knowledge, there is no empirical evidence that supports these hypotheses (beyond practitioners' personal experience). This article aims to contribute to fill thisgap by performing an empirical study on how well students understand entity-relationship database models as compared to structured query language (SQL) code. Several ER models and their corresponding SQL code (more specifically, the data definition language (DDL) statements required to create such models) were shown to a heterogeneous group of students, who answered different questions about the database systems represented by these artifacts. Then, we analysed the correctness of the answers to check whether the ER models really improved students' comprehension. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

  abstract = {In this article, we analyze conversations in consulting meetings where people work across disciplines to design things. We focus on interactional processes through which people disrupt and attempt to change representational technologies for scientific and technical classification. Our case material is drawn from ethnographic and cognitive studies of work in field entomology and architectural design. In both cases, we find common structures of interaction when people work across disciplines. These include selective use of talk, embodied action, and inscription to animate representational states that make up design alternatives. Participants from different disciplines animate situations in strikingly different ways, but these differences can either go unremarked or be put into coordinated use without explicit, shared understandings. Differences become remarkable either when a design proposal runs counter to deeply held disciplinary objectives or threatens to destabilize a wider network of representational technologies. These kinds of disruptions, and their consequences for representational infrastructure, are a central problem for research on distributed cognition. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Most research in the area concerns teaching methods, educational technology and student understanding/misconceptions. Typically, evaluation of learning outcome takes place during or immediately following the educational activity. In this research, we conduct a qualitative investigation of sustainability of programming competence by studying the effect of recalling programming competence long time after the educational activity has taken place. Our population consists of 10 students who have taken an introductory object-oriented programming course 3, 15 or 27 months prior to our study. None of the students have been exposed to programming in the intervening period. As expected, our research shows that syntactical issues in general hinder immediate programming productivity, but more interestingly it also indicate that a tiny retraining activity and simple guidelines is enough to recall programming competence and overcome syntactical issues.},

On a broader level, we also focus on the learning of the research team by documenting the conjectures about the students' statistical learning and the means of supporting it that the research team generated, tested, and revised on-line while the experiment was in progress. In the final part of the article, we synthesize the results of this learning by proposing a revised learning trajectory that can inform design and instruction in other classrooms. In doing so, we make a contribution to the cumulative development of a domain-specific instructional theory for statistical data analysis.},

Moreover, many of these studies, intended or not, rely on narrative accounts to communicate and justify their findings. Although narratives often purport to be true, there is nothing in narrative form that guarantees veracity. The authors provide a framework that links design-study research questions as they evolve over time with corresponding research methods.

My analysis consists in zooming to identify patterns that simultaneously occur at multiple levels. Zooming, therefore, embodies a reflexive relation to different figure-ground relations in the attentional field of the individuals I study. To exemplify my approach to research, I use data from a physics classroom where students learn to explain computer-animated microworld events in terms of newtonian theory.},

Previous studies have suggested that student knowledge of mechanics may be compartmentalized: their everyday intuition serves in everyday contexts and their scientific model is activated, if ever, in academic contexts. In this study we investigate a case where significant numbers of students appear to draw on different models of motion in what is essentially the same, academic context, i.e. the prediction of the motion of a block on a smooth surface under the action of horizontal forces. Many students exhibit combinations of Aristotelian-like intuitions and Newtonian conceptions depending on the magnitudes of the quantities involved. The students' experience of being taught Newtonian theory in mathematics and physics has small but significant effects on the explanations they offer. The notion of anchoring and bridging is re-examined as a teaching strategy in such situtions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Some issues are explored surrounding the identification of such intuitions, referred to as anchoring conceptions or anchors. We attempt to: (1) propose some organizing theoretical and observational definitions of the anchor construct; (2) present some initial findings from a diagnostic test designed to uncover anchors for physics instruction; and (3) provoke an initial discussion of the new methodological issues that arise in this domain.

The results of the diagnostic test indicate that a number of group anchors exist. In addition, some unexpected non-anchors were identified. Furthermore, evidence was found indicating that some anchoring examples may be 'brittle', i.e., evidence that the anchor could not be extended analogically to help a student make sense of a target situation.

Finally, it is suggested that further research is needed to construct a theory of anchoring conceptions that would, for example, specify what characteristics would indicate that an anchoring conception can provide the basis for conceptual change via analogical extension.},

For example, a student may frame a learning activity as an opportunity for sensemaking or as an assignment to fill out a worksheet. The student's framing affects what she notices, what knowledge she accesses, and how she thinks to act. We find evidence of framing in easily observed features of students' collaborative behavior. We apply this observational methodology to explore dynamics among behavior, framing, and the conceptual substance of student reasoning in the context of collaborative active-learning activities in an introductory university physics course. We find evidence that certain student behaviors indicate and support a relatively sophisticated epistemological framing of these activities, one in which students discuss the substance of the ideas at hand.

Of interest were the relationships between teaching models, scientific models, and students' mental models and expressed models. The results from classroom observations, interviews with students, and completion of student questionnaires showed that the majority of students involved in this study had a sound understanding of the descriptive nature of teaching models but their understanding of the predictive nature of those models was limited, despite their experience in using a variety of representations in chemistry class. The data suggest that teaching models can play a pivotal role in initiating students' development of scientific models, mental models, and expressed models. In light of these results, it is suggested that teaching models be used to predict, test and evaluate conceptions similar to the way that scientists use scientific models so that students appreciate the similarities of teaching models and scientific models.},

Three levels of goals were identified as operative in the learning situation: task-completion goals, instructional goals, and personal knowledge-building goals. Although protocol statements indicating knowledge-building goals were infrequent, students exhibiting a relatively high proportion of them were distinctive in several ways. They did significantly better on a posttest. Their performance in goal cue selections differed from that of other participants in ways consistent with their orientation: They responded more often to learning goal cues than to task goal cues. They actively related new learning to prior knowledge and they posed and tried to solve problems and questions. Students oriented toward instructional goals tended to focus on what was explicitly taught. Students oriented toward task-completion goals tended to equate learning with successful completion of assigned tasks. Level of goal orientation and posttest performance were unrelated to level of education and prior computer experience but were positively related to previous experience of independent learning.

  abstract = {We propose the concept of cultural validity as a form of test validity in science assessment. The conceptual relevance of cultural validity is supported by evidence that culture and society shape an individual's mind and thinking. To attain cultural validity, the process of assessment development must consider how the sociocultural context in which students live influences the ways in which they make sense of science items and the ways in which they solve them. These sociocultural influences include the values, beliefs, experiences, communication patterns, teaching and learning styles, and epistemologies inherent in the students' cultural backgrounds, as well as the socioeconomic conditions prevailing in their cultural groups. We contend that current approaches to handling student diversity in assessment (e.g., adapting or translating tests, providing assessment accommodations, estimating test cultural bias) are limited and lack sociocultural perspective. We find that attaining cultural validity may conflict with current basic principles and assumptions in testing, such as item independence and standardization. We discuss the ways in which adopting cultural validity as a criterion for test validity makes it necessary to shift assessment paradigms and adopt new procedures for assessment development. \dbend{} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

  abstract = {This article analyzes the quantitative and situational structure of algebra story problems, uses these materials to propose an interpretive framework for written problem-solving protocols, and then presents an exploratory study of the episodic structure of algebra story problem solving in a sizable group of mathematically competent undergraduates. Analyses of written protocols compare the strategic, tactical, and conceptual content of solution attempts, looking within these attempts at the interplay between problem comprehension and solution. Comprehension and solution of algebra story problems are complementary activities, giving rise to a succession of problem-solving episodes. Although direct algebraic problem solving is sometimes effective, results suggest that the algebraic formalism may be of little help in comprehending the quantitative constraints posed in a problem text. Instead, competent problem solvers often reason within the situational context presented by a story problem, using various forms of model-based reasoning to identify, pursue, and verify quantitative constraints required for solution. The article concludes by discussing the implications of these finding for acquiring mathematical concepts (e.g., related linear functions) and for supporting their acquisition through instruction.},

Two questions are explored: How do students de- scribe cooperative group work in their mathematics class? How do students de- scribe the way their socially constructed identities influence the nature of their group interactions in mathematics classrooms? The authors present a case study of the ways in which race, gender, and other social identities might influence the nature of group work in reform-oriented high school mathematics classrooms. The analysis, based on 14 interviews with high school students, focused on stu- dents' perceptions of group work and their theories about when cooperative groups work well and when they do not. Students named interactional style, mathematical understanding, and friendships and relationships as the most influential factors. Using an analytic lens informed, in part, by critical race theory, the authors highlight the racialized and gendered nature of these factors.},

  abstract = {$<$p$>$We propose the bagplot, a bivariate generalization of the univariate boxplot. The key notion is the halfspace location depth of a point relative to a bivariate dataset, which extends the univariate concept of rank. The "depth median" is the deepest location, and it is surrounded by a "bag" containing the n/2 observations with largest depth. Magnifying the bag by a factor 3 yields the "fence" (which is not plotted). Observations between the bag and the fence are marked by a light gray loop, whereas observations outside the fence are flagged as outliers. The bagplot visualizes the location, spread, correlation, skewness, and tails of the data. It is equivariant for linear transformations, and not limited to elliptical distributions. Software for drawing the bagplot is made available for the S-Plus and MATLAB environments. The bagplot is illustrated on several datasets-for example, in a scatterplot matrix of multivariate data.$<$/p$>$},

By comparing a wide range of building layouts for similar organizations one may achieve a good understanding of the ways in which goals and values can be expressed in spatial solutions, It offers the opportunity to develop a spatiofunctional typology of design solutions. Postoccupancy evaluations focusing on underlying arguments and user experiences with different design solutions give insight into relevant points of decision, (dis)advantages for use and perception, and (dis)congruencies between spatial systems and social systems. This article demonstrates how an integration of comparative floorplan-analysis and postoccupancy evaluation may contribute to more soundly based solutions in programming and architectural design. The relationship between spatial and social configurations is illuminated by an analysis of the floorplans of two schools with different educational systems and the spatial implications of a shift from a medical care concept into a residential care concept in nursing homes.},

  abstract = {$<$p$>$$<$br/$>$Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments, particularly environments where students share external representations, are discussed as an interesting area for the application of cognitive load theory (CLT). CSCL environments share a number of characteristics that will induce considerable cognitive load. This article reflects on the characteristics of CSCL environments and external representations and the research opportunities they offer to CLT. We argue that CLT can contribute to our understanding of CSCL by pinpointing situations in which high levels of cognitive load are generated. CLT also raises a number of particular issues: from a CLT point of view studying of worked out external representations may lead to better learning outcomes than (co)-construction which is the standard mode of operation in CSCL. The ontology and specificity of the representational scheme used are crucial factors, as they define what can be expressed and how much room for interpretation is left in the representation. CLT may help identify mismatches between representational schemes and execution of (sub)tasks. CLT has lead to a number of recommendations on the integration of diagrammatic and textual information. We relate this to discussion and chat facilities in CSCL and describe how these can be more firmly anchored in the external representation.$<$/p$>$},

Nowhere is this challenge more evident and therefore more problematic than in the application of post-modernism (in the form of constructivist teaching) to the classroom. Employing constructivist teaching practices is problematic at two levels: (1) there is an absence of empirical evidence of effectiveness; and (2) employing this approach for which there is a lack of evidential support, means not employing instructional practices for which there is empirical support. The purpose of this article is to present an overview and critique of constructivist teaching practices, followed by a brief review of evidenced-based practices in teaching.},

For concurrent schedules (i.e., simultaneous choice procedures), there is matching between the relative frequencies of responding and reinforcement; for multiple schedules (i.e., successive discrimination procedures), there are contrast effects between responding in each component and reinforcement in the others; and for single schedules, there are a host of increasing monotonic relations between the rate of responding and the rate of reinforcement. All these results, plus several others, can be accounted for by a coherent system of equations, the most general of which states that the absolute rate of any response is proportional to its associated relative reinforcement.},

We discuss how these organisational realities shape (1) requirements testing; (2) test coverage; (3) test automation; and (4) test scenario design.},

Here we introduce recursive feedback (RF), which occurs when tutors observe their pupils use what they have been taught. Two experiments examined the value of RF during learning by teaching. In the first study adults taught another adult face to face about human biology. Those participants who observed their pupil interact with an examiner exhibited superior learning relative to individuals in several control conditions that included elements of learning by teaching but not RF. The second study examined whether RF benefits extend to teaching computerized teachable agents in regular classrooms. High school students played games in which they induced logical rules. Students taught their agent the governing rules. They received RF when they observed their teachable agent play a prediction game against a second competitor agent. On a posttest, these students exhibited greater abilities to use logic to solve novel problems compared to students in control conditions who received direct feedback by playing against the competitor agent themselves. RF may further generalize to nonteaching situations that also involve a production\textendash{}appropriation cycle, such as do-it-yourself projects in which people have a chance to learn from how other people take up their handiwork.},

Concerning the possible reasons for these difficulties, little attention has been paid to the way mathematics is treated in physics instruction. Starting from an overall distinction between a technical approach, which involves an instrumental (tool-like) use of mathematics, and a structural one, focused on reasoning about the physical world mathematically, the goal of this study is to characterize the development of the latter in didactic contexts. For this purpose, a case study was conducted on the electromagnetism course given by a distinguished physics professor. The analysis of selected teaching episodes with the software Videograph led to the identification of a set of categories that describe different strategies used by the professor to emphasize the structural role of mathematics in his lectures. As a consequence of this research, an analytic tool to enable future comparative studies between didactic approaches regarding the way mathematics is treated in physics teaching is provided.},

  abstract = {SummaryBackground
Tracheal tumours can be surgically resected but most are an inoperable size at the time of diagnosis; therefore, new therapeutic options are needed. We report the clinical transplantation of the tracheobronchial airway with a stem-cell-seeded bioartificial nanocomposite.
Methods
A 36-year-old male patient, previously treated with debulking surgery and radiation therapy, presented with recurrent primary cancer of the distal trachea and main bronchi. After complete tumour resection, the airway was replaced with a tailored bioartificial nanocomposite previously seeded with autologous bone-marrow mononuclear cells via a bioreactor for 36 h. Postoperative granulocyte colony-stimulating factor filgrastim (10 $\mu$g/kg) and epoetin beta (40\hphantom{,}000 UI) were given over 14 days. We undertook flow cytometry, scanning electron microscopy, confocal microscopy epigenetics, multiplex, miRNA, and gene expression analyses.
Findings
We noted an extracellular matrix-like coating and proliferating cells including a CD105+ subpopulation in the scaffold after the reseeding and bioreactor process. There were no major complications, and the patient was asymptomatic and tumour free 5 months after transplantation. The bioartificial nanocomposite has patent anastomoses, lined with a vascularised neomucosa, and was partly covered by nearly healthy epithelium. Postoperatively, we detected a mobilisation of peripheral cells displaying increased mesenchymal stromal cell phenotype, and upregulation of epoetin receptors, antiapoptotic genes, and miR-34 and miR-449 biomarkers. These findings, together with increased levels of regenerative-associated plasma factors, strongly suggest stem-cell homing and cell-mediated wound repair, extracellular matrix remodelling, and neovascularisation of the graft.
Interpretation
Tailor-made bioartificial scaffolds can be used to replace complex airway defects. The bioreactor reseeding process and pharmacological-induced site-specific and graft-specific regeneration and tissue protection are key factors for successful clinical outcome.

  abstract = {We explain certain learning difficulties in computer science education as resulting from a clash between the students' culture as computer users and the professional computing culture. We propose the concept of fertile zones of cultural encounter as a way of overcoming these learning difficulties. This pedagogical approach aims to bridge the gap between cultures by designing interventions that are appreciated by members of both cultures, yet also guide the student to engage in the practices of the professional culture. The learning difficulties are demonstrated by a detailed analysis of episodes taken from an advanced high school computer science course in concurrency. We show that fertile zones of cultural encounter can be successful in significantly improving learning of this subject. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

The data were found to be consistent with a theoretical framework that differentiates between instrumental and relational learning. The intense speed with which material was covered and the complexity of the material was found to drive even those students who valued a relational understanding towards functioning as instrumental learners. Particular attention is paid to one participant in the study, Parker, who had been a successful chemistry major until he entered the second year organic course.},

One must also check that there is good reason to believe that each statement follows from the preceding statements or from other accepted knowledge, i.e., that there is a valid warrant for making that statement in the context of this argument. We then report an exploratory study in which we investigated the behavior of 13 undergraduates when they were asked to determine whether or not a particular flawed mathematical argument is a valid mathematical proof. The last line of this purported proof was true, but did not follow legitimately from the earlier assertions in the proof. Our findings were that only six of these undergraduates recognized that this argument was invalid and only two did so for legitimate mathematical reasons. On a more positive note, when asked to consider whether the last line of the proof followed from previous assertions, a total of 10 students concluded that the statement did not and rejected the proof as invalid.},

Social interactions in some teams are respectful, while on other teams some members expect others to carry the load, but take credit for it later. With engineering teamwork becoming more prevalent on engineering campuses, knowing more about student design teams that work is especially important. This article uses two teamwork cases from a large-scale ethnographic study of an engineering design program to describe not only the ways that student engineers practiced design teamwork, but also how campus culture reached into social interactions between teammates via engineering identities produced on campus. A model for effective teamwork emerged that implies producing high quality engineering products, and doing so through respectful social interactions. Implications for teaching about teamwork, teaching with teams, and thinking about ways to change campus cultures to better promote design engineering are developed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Our data indicate effective formal and informal recruiting, contact with dynamic individuals who conveyed commitment to and excitement about the department and program, and a department that welcomed immigrants and promoted a dear, relevant image of its discipline's identity, influenced student decisions to relocate within STEM rather than attrite. The high proportion of females within the immigrant students is one factor contributing to the department's attainment of sex parity. Our students' stories offer lessons to other departments for attracting and retaining students who enter the higher education STEM pipeline. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Repeatedly, students are seen to confuse features applicable to one level across multiple levels despite instruction. Although many instances of such `levels confusion' have been documented, little is known about the generation or reconciliation of levels confusion in the science classroom. The present study examines the nature of teacher\textendash{}student discourse practices that generate, maintain, and reconcile levels confusion in chemistry. We present two case studies of whole class discussions of chemical and physical changes to illustrate how teachers and students enter the chemistry classroom biased to reason about chemistry phenomena from very different descriptive levels. Microanalysis of teacher\textendash{}student discourse practices show how teachers implicitly refer to multiple descriptive levels during instruction and employ technical definitions and heuristics that tacitly appeal to multiple levels simultaneously. Our analysis suggests that levels confusion in chemistry arises from multiples sources that include the epistemological assumptions of chemistry, representational practices of the domain, and epistemological moves made by teachers in classroom discourse.},

Several dimensions of design thinking are then detailed, explaining why design is hard to learn and harder still to teach, and outlining the research available on how well design thinking skills are learned. The currently most-favored pedagogical model for teaching design, project-based learning (PBL), is explored next, along with available assessment data on its success. Two contexts for PBL are emphasized: first-year cornerstone courses and globally dispersed PBL courses. Finally, the paper lists some of the open research questions that must be answered to identify the best pedagogical practices of improving design learning, after which it closes by making recommendations for research aimed at enhancing design learning.},

To build a bridge between students' everyday knowledge and scientific concepts, the role of metaphors and analogies came into the focus of the science education community during the past two decades. Approaches using metaphor-based teaching strategies often regard metaphors and analogies as teaching tools that can be adopted by a teacher. On the basis of the theoretical framework of experientialism, we argue that not only teaching but also thinking about and understanding science without metaphors and analogies is not possible. An analysis of studies dealing with metaphors and analogies in science education shows that instructional analogies and metaphors are often not understood as intended or not used by students in their own explanations. By reanalyzing 199 instructional metaphors and analogies on the basis of a metaphor analysis, we show that it takes more than making a connection to everyday life to communicate science fruitfully. We show that good instructional metaphors and analogies need embodied sources. These embodied sources are everyday experiences conceptualized in, for example, schemata such as containers, paths, balances, and up and down. For the analysis, we introduce the concept of conceptual metaphors for analyzing metaphors as well as analogies. \textcopyright{} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed 96:849\textendash{}877, 2012},

  abstract = {This study demonstrates the power of the cultural encounter metaphor in explaining learning and teaching difficulties, using as an example computer science education (CSE). CSE is envisioned as an encounter between veterans of two computer-oriented cultures, that of the teachers and that of the students. Forty questionnaires administered to CS teachers, as well as in-depth interviews with four leading CS teachers, revealed those teachers perceived their students as having a different perspective on the domain, on what constitutes a beneficial approach to problem-solving and on the nature of satisfactory solutions. In fact, the teachers portrayed their teaching as a continual battle in which their success is limited. Yet, their instruction was characterized as a composite of enforcement and compromise, with few and isolated attempts at building on students' cultural capital. The cultural encounter metaphor, while still viewing students as novices to the professional CS culture represented by their teachers, emphasizes that good teaching requires building upon students' cultural capital to create zones of fertile cultural encounter .

Yet, it appears that this work has had minimal influence on the fundamental teaching practices of the typical physics faculty. To better understand this situation, interviews were conducted with five likely users of physics education research. All reported making changes in their instructional practices and all were influenced, to some extent, by educational research. Yet, none made full use of educational research and most had complaints about their interactions with educational researchers. In this paper we examine how these instructors used educational research in making instructional decisions and identify divergent expectations about how researchers and faculty can work together to improve student learning. Although different instructors emphasized different aspects of this discrepancy between expectations, we believe that they are all related to a single underlying issue: the typical dissemination model is to disseminate curricular innovations and have faculty adopt them with minimal changes, while faculty expect researchers to work with them to incorporate research-based knowledge and materials into their unique instructional situations. Implications and recommendations are discussed.},

Debugging is particularly problematic for novice programmers. Some previous studies suggest this difficulty may be lessened by working in pairs. Using transactive analysis, we examined interactions between five pairs of university-level introductory programming students as they debugged Java programs. Transcriptions of their verbal interactions were coded into transactive statement categories which revealed that the nature of participants' discourse varied. Extensions, feedback requests, critiques and completions were the most frequently observed types of transactions. Other transaction types were rarely detected in this context. The amount of discussion for the pairs varied as did the number of transactive statements. Results suggest that pairs who talked more and used completion transactions more often attempted more problems, but those who critiqued more frequently successfully debugged more problems. The teaching implications of this work and recommendations for future research are discussed.},

Attempts to detect frustration at a finer grain-size, identifying individual students' fluctuations in frustration between labs, were less successful. These results indicate that it is possible to detect frustration at a coarse-grained level, solely from coarse-grained data about students' behavior within a learning environment.},

Our primary finding is that although the three TAs discussed here share a common behavior, the beliefs and motivations that underlie this behavior vary. We argue that TA professional development focused on changing these TAs' focus-on-indicator behavior is unlikely to be effective. Instead, responsive TA professional development will need to address the TAs' beliefs that guide the observed classroom behavior.},

The study was carried out through interviews with secondary school teachers aimed at learning how they describe their work with proof in the classroom, and to elicit beliefs and other factors that shape this work. Through the interviews we were able to detect reasons behind teachers' choices in planning their work in the classroom. In the present paper, we concentrate on four cases that, among other factors, offer elements suitable to unravel the problem of inconsistencies using the construct of leading beliefs, i.e., beliefs (whose nature may vary from teacher to teacher) that seem to drive the way each teacher treats proof.},

Dr. Skinner's experimental work has been concerned with an analysis of the effects of reinforcement in learning, and the designing of techniques by which reinforcement can be manipulated with considerable precision. He points out that perhaps the most serious criticism of the current classroom is the relative infrequency of reinforcement, and suggests how the results of certain scientific research in the field of learning can be brought to bear upon practical problems in education. In order to take advantage of recent advances in the study of learning, the teacher must have the help of mechanical devices. In presenting the advantages to be gained from instrumental help in teaching, Dr. Skinner also deals with objections which may be raised to the use of such mechanical aids in instruction. Dr. Skinner, author of Walden Two and Science and Human Behavior, is Professor of Psychology at Harvard University. He was recently elected President of the Eastern Psychological Association.

However, learning them is challenging for most students and many of them have various types of misconceptions on how algorithms work. In this study, we discuss the problem of identifying misconceptions on the principles of how algorithms work. Our context is algorithm simulation exercises, where students simulate the steps of a given algorithm by manipulating data structure visualizations on a computer screen by using a mouse. Thus, contrasting to ``typical'' data structures and algorithms courses, these exercises are designed to work on an abstraction level higher than that of the actual implementation. We have analyzed the recorded simulation sequences to infer existing misconceptions from students' answers, and then implemented the corresponding variations of the target algorithm to find out how many of students' answers consistently follow each variation. The results suggest that many students are aware of the ultimate goal of the algorithm but have not studied the algorithm itself well enough. This often leads to different misconceptions that can be modeled and recognized using our approach. The results presented here concern the Build \textendash{} Heap algorithm, but the approach is of general value.},

From this point of view, instruction requires a sort of bootstrapping, in which students move from having little ability to use a sign system, to becoming fluent users of that sign system. In this commentary, I contrast the view of science learning outlined by Wertsch and Kazak with what I refer to as the conceptual change perspective. Based on this contrast, I argue that Wertsch and Kazak systematically underestimate what students know, as well as how much intersubjective overlap there is between student and instructor.},

  doi = {10.1007/s10649-005-9003-3},
  abstract = {This paper focuses on the kinds of notations young children make for fractional numbers. The extant literature in the area of fractional numbers acknowledges children's difficulties in conceptualizing fractional numbers. Some of the research suggests possibly delaying an introduction to conventional notations for algorithms and fractions until children have developed a better understanding of fractional numbers (e.g., Hunting, 1987; S{\'a}enz-Ludlow, 1994, 1995). Other research (e.g., Empson, 1999), however, acknowledges the interaction between conceptual understandings and the representations for those understandings. Following the latter line of thinking, this paper argues that children's notational competencies and conceptual understandings are intertwined, addressing the following research questions: (a) What kinds of notations do five and six-year-old children make for fractional numbers?; and (b) What can be learned about young children's learning of fractional numbers by analyzing the notations they make? This paper presents data from interviews carried out with twenty-four children in Kindergarten and first grade (five and six-year-old children), exploring the nuances of their notations and the meanings that they attach to fractions.},

This research adds to conversations about identity in practice, especially identity production in science education, by suggesting the importance of cultural forms for belonging, especially at an obdurate site of science practice like the campus studied.},

  abstract = {$<$p$>$This article tells the story of the design of Learning by Design\texttrademark{} (LBD), a project-based inquiry approach to science learning with roots in case-based reasoning and problem-based learning, pointing out the theoretical contributions of both, classroom issues that arose upon piloting a first attempt, ways we addressed those challenges, lessons learned about promoting learning taking a project-based inquiry approach, and lessons learned about taking a theory-based approach to designing learning environments. LBD uses what we know about cognition to fashion a learning environment appropriate to deeply learning science concepts and skills and their applicability, in parallel with learning cognitive, social, learning, and communication skills. Our goal, in designing LBD, was to lay the foundation in middle school for students to be successful thinkers, learners, and decisionmakers throughout their lives and especially to help them begin to learn the science they need to know to thrive in the modern world. LBD has students learn science in the context of achieving design-and-build challenges. Included in LBD's framework is a set of ritualized and sequenced activities that help teachers and students acclimate to the culture of a highly collaborative, learner-centered, inquiry-oriented, and design-based classroom. Those ritualized activities help teachers and students learn the practices of scientists, engineers, and group members in ways that they can use outside the classroom. LBD is carefully crafted to promote deep and lasting learning, but we have learned that careful crafting is not enough for success in putting a collaborative inquiry approach into practice. Also essential are fostering a collaborative classroom culture in which students want to be engaged in deep learning and where the teacher sees herself as both a learner and a facilitator of learning, trusts that with her help the students can learn, and enthusiastically assumes the roles she needs to take on.},

  abstract = {The role that personal epistemology plays in intellectual development, learning, and education has been investigated for several decades in the USA (see Hofer \& Pintrich, 1997, 2002) and has recently been pursued in other cultural environments. Research suggests that epistemological understanding has important implications for learning: for example, beliefs about the nature of knowledge may influence strategy use, comprehension, cognitive processing, and conceptual change learning. However, the primary constructs regarding students' conceptions of knowledge and knowing were all developed with US college students, and the initial research on which most models are based was conducted with white males at an elite institution in the 1950s and 1960s (Perry, 1970). Furthermore, measurement of epistemic beliefs has typically been formulated and validated in the USA and then applied in other cultures by translating existing instruments and presuming similar factor structures. In recent years, however, research on epistemic beliefs and development has been expanding in its comprehensiveness, particularly in regard to research in multiple cultures, providing potential challenges and possible expansion of existing models. In this introductory chapter, I will provide a brief overview of personal epistemology from multiple paradigms (Hofer, 2004b), review examples of research conducted across cultures, and suggest implications of a more culturally informed personal epistemology both for multicultural education and for future research.},

Jason and Laura, who participated in the teaching experiment, Children's Construction of the Rational Numbers of Arithmetic. 5 teaching episodes were held with the 2 children, October 15 and November 1, 8, 15, and 22. During the fourth grade, the 2 children demonstrated distinctly different partitioning schemes -- the equi-partitioning scheme (Jason) and the simultaneous partitioning scheme (Laura). At the outset of the children's fifth grade, it was hypothesized that the differences in the 2 schemes would be manifest in the children's production of fractions commensurate with a given fraction. During the October 15 teaching episode, Jason independently produced how much 3/4 of I/4 of a stick was of the whole stick as a novelty, and it was inferred that he engaged in recursive partitioning operations. An analogous inference could not be made for Laura. The primary difference in the 2 children during the teaching episodes was Laura's dependency on Jason's independent explanations or actions to engage in the actions that were needed for her to be successful in explaining why a fraction such as I/3 was commensurate to, say, 4/12.

  abstract = {We investigate the dynamics of student behaviors (posture, gesture, vocal register, visual focus) and the substance of their reasoning during collaborative work on inquiry-based physics tutorials. Scherr has characterized student activity during tutorials as observable clusters of behaviors separated by sharp transitions, and has argued that these behavioral modes reflect students' epistemological framing of what they are doing, i.e., their sense of what is taking place with respect to knowledge. We analyze students' verbal reasoning during several tutorial sessions using the framework of Russ, and find a strong correlation between certain behavioral modes and the scientific quality of students' explanations. We suggest that this is due to a dynamic coupling of how students behave, how they frame an activity, and how they reason during that activity. This analysis supports the earlier claims of a dynamic between behavior and epistemology. We discuss implications for research and instruction.},

This study relates an amalgam of theories on learning and gender to the context of engineering education. Based on data from a qualitative study of an electrical and electronics engineering study programme, this study found that studying engineering in a PBL environment involves not only the mastery of technological knowledge but also an engineering identity development process. However, the association of an engineering identity with masculinity and the culturally defined engineering competencies leads to different learning experiences for male and female students. The nature of hard-core engineering subjects, based on male interests, privileges men and acts as a barrier to women. The masculine culture in engineering communities of practice involves more effort in identity management for women students than their male peers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

The 2nd goal is to move away from talking of a single constructivist learning environment, and instead to explore the nuances of learning environments based on different theoretical assumptions. Toward these ends, we analyze 2 summer camps in terms of theoretical assumptions, community and groups, participant roles, practices, and other evidence of learning. We conclude with a discussion of similarities and distinctions between these 2 learning environments, highlighting issues of ownership, authenticity, power, and task structure.},

Adopting this approach could help reduce the dogmatism evident in the methodology wars, although struggles for advantage would clearly remain.},

Using three case studies of ``process improvement'', the purpose of this article is to show how measurement takes place in manufacturing industry. We ask: What are the key issues involved in measurement that should inform the design of education and training for measurement? First, our research suggests that the definition of measurement should be enhanced so as to include the quantification of processes and multivariate constructs that aim to capture key performance indicators of production processes. Secondly, technology plays a complex role because it can lead not only to automation and increased invisibility of data, but also to the availability of information otherwise not accessible. Thirdly, we suggest that the use of the inferentialist concept of ``web of reasons'' in addition to more commonly used concepts such as ``practice'' or ``activity'' can help to focus not only on the what and how , but also on the why of measurement.},

The resources that are used for learning by these technicians are varied and complex and lie in the realms of the physical affordances of technical objects, particular forms of discourse, and in the social relationships that are built around the service department. In managing the troubles between machines and people in the supermarkets under their care, the technicians use the rich collection of locally available resources for learning in their daily work life that ensures them a central place in this community of practice.},

After a total of 85 hours of on-the-job observation, we report on the common abilities evidenced by new software developers including how to program, how to write design specifications, and evidence of persistence strategies for problem-solving. We also classify some of the common ways new software developers were observed getting stuck: communication, collaboration, technical, cognition, and orientation. We report on some common misconceptions of new developers which often frustrate them and hinder them in their jobs, and conclude with recommendations to align Computer Science curricula with the observed needs of new professional developers.},

  doi = {10.1207/s15516709cog0401_1},
  abstract = {I am struck by how little is known about so much of cognition. One goal of this paper is to argue for the need to consider a rich set of interlocking issues in the study of cognition. Mainstream work in cognition\textemdash{}including my own\textemdash{}ignores many critical aspects of animate cognitive systems. Perhaps one reason that existing theories say so little relevant to real world activities is the neglect of social and cultural factors, of emotion, and of the major points that distinguish an animate cognitive system from an artificial one: the need to survive, to regulate its own operation, to maintain itself, to exist in the environment, to change from a small, uneducated, immature system to an adult, developed, knowledgeable one.

Human cognition is not the same as artificial cognition, if only because the human organism must also be concerned with the problems of life, of development, of survival. There must be a regulatory system that interacts with the cognitive component. And it may well be that it is the cognitive component that is subservient, evolved primarily for the benefit of the regulatory system, working through the emotions, through affect.

I argue that several concepts must become fundamental parts of the study of cognition, including the roles of culture, of social interaction, of emotions, and of motivation. I argue that there are at least 12 issues that should comprise the study of cognition, and thereby, the field of Cognitive Science. We need to study a wide variety of behavior before we can hope to understand a single class. Cognitive scientists as a whole ought to make more use of evidence from the neurosciences, from brain damage and mental illness, from cognitive sociology and anthropology, and from clinical studies of the human. These must be accompanied, of course, with the study of language, of the psychological aspects of human processing structures, and of artificially intelligent mechanisms. The study of Cognitive Science requires a complex interaction among different issues of concern, an interaction that will not be properly understood until all parts are understood, with no part independent of the others, the whole requiring the parts, and the parts the whole.},

This investigation is related to the larger question of the efficacy of culturally sensitive instruction. The major premise on which the hypotheses of this study are based is the proposal that African American adolescents who are skilled in signifying use certain strategies to process signifying dialogue. These strategies are comparable to those that expert readers use in order to construct inferences about figurative passages in narrative texts. In order to apply this premise, an instructional unit was designed aimed at helping students bring to a conscious level the strategies it is presumed they use tacitly in social discourse. This approach is offered as a model of cognitive apprenticing based on cultural foundations. Analyses are presented of how the cultural practice links to heuristic strategies that experts use in a specific domain, as well as how instructors modeled, coached, and scaffolded students. /// [Spanish] Este estudio investig{\'o} las implicancias del lintercambio de ofensas rituales, una forma de discurso social de la comunidad afro-americana, como andamiaje para ense{\~n}ar habilidades de interpretaci{\'o}n literaria.

We make the case that problem-solving expertise should include opportunistically blending of conceptual and formal mathematical reasoning even while manipulating equations. We present analysis of interviews with two students, Alex and Pat. Interviewed students were asked to explain a particular equation and solve a problem using that equation. Alex used and described the equation as a computational tool. By contrast, Pat found a shortcut to solve the problem. His shortcut blended mathematical operations with conceptual reasoning about physical processes, reflecting a view\textemdash{}expressed earlier in his explanation of the equation\textemdash{}that equations can express an overarching conceptual meaning. Using case studies of Alex and Pat, we argue that this opportunistic blending of conceptual and formal mathematical reasoning (i) is a part of problem-solving expertise, (ii) can be described in terms of cognitive elements called symbolic forms (Sherin, 2001), and (iii) is a feasible instructional target.},

A review of CSCL conference proceedings revealed a general vagueness in definitions of units of analysis. In general, arguments for choosing a unit were lacking and decisions made while developing the content analysis procedures were not made explicit. In this article, it will be illustrated that the currently accepted practices concerning the `unit of meaning' are not generally applicable to quantitative content analysis of electronic communication. Such analysis is affected by `unit boundary overlap' and contextual constraints having to do with the technology used. The analysis of e-mail communication required a different unit of analysis and segmentation procedure. This procedure proved to be reliable, and the subsequent coding of these units for quantitative analysis yielded satisfactory reliabilities. These findings have implications and recommendations for current content analysis practice in CSCL research.},

A simple graphical approach that is particularly relevant to dependent sample comparisons is presented, illustrated and discussed in the context of analyzing five real data sets. Each data set to be presented has been published in a textbook, usually introductory. Illustrations show that comprehensive graphical analyses often yield more nuanced, and sometimes quite different interpretations of data than are derived from standard numerical summaries. Indeed, several of our findings would not readily have been revealed without the aid of graphic or visual assessment. Several arguments made by John Tukey about data analysis are seen to have special force and relevance.},

We illustrate the general concept of what we describe as elemental graphics: displays that afford direct visualizations of data with respect to fundamental questions that drive particular statistical methods. Attention is directed to methods that have both descriptive and inferential features through a focus on what can be seen as elemental graphics for analysis of variance. Our graphics are partly pedagogical in nature, highlighting the fundamental comparisons and outcomes made in the conduct of an ANOVA; however, their use readily extends well beyond pedagogy. These graphics can be helpful in the analysis of nearly any data set for which the corresponding method is applicable. The graphics were created using our graphical ANOVA R package granova.1},

  volume = {101},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND

Design is essential to the engineering profession and plays a crucial role in preparation for future practice. Research investigating variations of how professional designers experience, give meaning to, and approach design can inform the ways we characterize, assess, and facilitate design learning. This may also have significant implications for preparing future engineering professionals to collaborate within and across disciplines.
PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS)

The goal of the study was to reveal and investigate critical differences in how designers from within and outside of engineering disciplines understand what it means to design, and how those understandings are evident in their approaches to and progression through design work.
DESIGN/METHOD

A qualitative research approach called phenomenography was used to investigate critical variations in how individuals experience and understand design. Twenty practicing designers were interviewed regarding their design experiences, how they approach design, and the ways they understand design.
CONCLUSIONS

Six qualitatively distinct lenses on how individuals across disciplines experience and come to understand design emerged, comprising a phenomenographic ``outcome space.'' These include design as (1) evidencebased decision-making, (2) organized translation, (3) personal synthesis, (4) intentional progression, (5) directed creative exploration, and (6) freedom. Theoretical implications include an understanding of how design skills and knowledge come together to form a design approach, while practical implications emphasize structuring variation-based reflection, which can facilitate common ground as a result of recognizing differ ``design lenses.''},

Starting from a model that characterizes designs in terms of problem analyses, design solutions, and design processes, I describe 3 types of theories that can be developed through design research: domain theories, design frameworks, and design methodologies. I present examples from a design research program investigating software supports for reflective inquiry. I argue for design research as form of educational research because (a) design offers opportunities to learn unique lessons, (b) design research yields practical lessons that can be directly applied, and (c) design research engages researchers in the direct improvement of educational practice.},

In the first study adults taught another adult face to face about human biology. Those participants who observed their pupil interact with an examiner exhibited superior learning relative to individuals in several control conditions that included elements of learning by teaching but not RF. The second study examined whether RF benefits extend to teaching computerized teachable agents in regular classrooms. High school students played games in which they induced logical rules. Students taught their agent the governing rules. They received RF when they observed their teachable agent play a prediction game against a second competitor agent. On a posttest, these students exhibited greater abilities to use logic to solve novel problems compared to students in control conditions who received direct feedback by playing against the competitor agent themselves. RF may further generalize to nonteaching situations that also involve a production\textendash{}appropriation cycle, such as do-it-yourself projects in which people have a chance to learn from how other people take up their handiwork.},

As a result, it often focused on the problems faced by elementary- and secondary-school students encountering chemistry topics for the first time. Because a large fraction of the students enrolled in chemistry courses at the tertiary level can be found in first-year courses, it is not surprising that as research expanded to studies of college and university students, it began by looking at the experiences of students in introductory courses. Recent years have seen a significant increase in the number of research studies that focus on students in upper-level courses at the undergraduate and graduate level. This is an important development because of the different cognitive and pedagogical challenges that are encountered in 'advanced' courses. This special issue of CERP is therefore devoted to studies that have the potential of producing changes in the way upper-level courses are taught that are equivalent to the changes that research on the teaching and learning of chemistry by high-school and introductory level students has had on the way courses for these students are being taught.},

However, providing students with practical experience with measurement in a classroom setting can be so time-consuming and intrusive that it's counter-productive-teaching students that software measurement is "impractical" for many software development contexts. In this research, we designed and evaluated a very low-overhead approach to measurement collection and analysis using the Hackystat system with special features for classroom use. We deployed this system in two software engineering classes at the University of Hawaii during Fall, 2003, and collected quantitative and qualitative data to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach. Results indicate that the approach represents substantial progress toward practical, automated metrics collection and analysis, though issues relating to the complexity of installation and privacy of user data remain.},

This research approach is especially appropriate in new topic areas. The resultant theory is often novel, testable, and empirically valid. Finally, framebreaking insights, the tests of good theory (e.g., parsimony, logical coherence), and convincing grounding in the evidence are the key criteria for evaluating this type of research.},

Such questions included: what do you expect to do on a day-to-day basis, how did you become interested in engineering, what are the characteristics that make a good engineer, and others. In responses to such questions students described how they imagined engineering workplaces and the work of engineering. We found that students in their first year of preparation to become engineers knew little about what kind of work they would be doing in the future as engineers. That is, they developed hopeful images of engineering. In some cases these images were altered or augmented in later years to become more mundane. For some students images from the first year remained virtually unchanged into their fourth year. Our discussion reflects how students' identities are affected both by common, widely circulating images of engineering and the absence of real workplace experiences in the undergraduate engineering education.},

Then we will look at these interpretive acts, and abstract a framework. This version of this paper won't work this way; we're going to present the framework before the examples. But that's the way, conceptually, that this endeavor has worked.},

  title = {Student Social Capital and Retention in the College of Engineering},
  abstract = {An investigation of relationships between student social capital and retention in the engineering program and the use of the concept of social capital as a framework to understand the retention of engineering students are discussed. The concept of social capital has been utilized in investigations of economic productivity and innovation of corporations, drop-out rates in high school, and academic performance both in high school and in college. For the purposes of this study, social capital consists of social networks, social norms, and the value of these networks and norms for achieving mutual goals. Previous research suggests that the peer group and faculty support are both important factors in student retention and academic success. It has even been suggested that the peer group is the single most influential factor on personal development in college. Student social capital was assessed in one-on-one and focus group interviews with both students that have left engineering and students that remain. The focus of the interviews was on student interactions with peers, faculty, and teaching assistants, and students' integration and perception of the engineering culture. Student responses indicate that social capital does play a role in the retention of engineering students. Both students that remain in engineering and those that have left reported that positive interactions with peers, faculty, and advisors were important to retention. Both groups indicated that few opportunities exist in the lecture setting to interact with other students, but the dorms provide opportunities to develop relationships with other students. Both groups voiced frustration with mostly poor interactions with faculty and advisors. Similarly, both groups indicated that their sense of community in freshman engineering courses is low, and they are frustrated with the competitive norms in engineering. Only those students that left engineering voiced dissatisfaction with teaching methods that encourage plug and chug problem solving, characterized by little discussion or opportunities to ask questions about assumptions or approaches. Recommendations are made to address student concerns that include active and cooperative learning approaches, and the development of learning communities.},

  abstract = {Seventy kindergarten children who had spent the year solving a variety of basic word problems were individually interviewed as they solved addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, multistep, and nonroutine word problems. Thirty-two children used a valid strategy for all nine problems and 44 correctly answered seven or more problems. Only 5 children were not able to answer any problems correctly. The results suggest that children can solve a wide range of problems, including problems involving multiplication and division situations, much earlier than generally has been presumed. With only a few exceptions, children's strategies could be characterized as representing or modeling the action or relationships described in the problems. The conception of problem solving as modeling could provide a unifying framework for thinking about problem solving in the primary grades. Modeling offers a parsimonious and coherent way of thinking about children's mathematical problem solving that is relatively straightforward and is accessible to teachers and students alike.},

This essay considers one teacher's response to the new policy. She sees herself as a success for the policy: she believes that she has revolutionized her mathematics teaching. But observation of her classroom reveals that the innovations in her teaching have been filtered through a very traditional approach to instruction. The result is a remarkable melange of novel and traditional material. Policy has affected practice in this case, but practice has had an even greater effect on policy.},

  abstract = {Although much is known about the differences between expert and novice problem solvers, knowledge of those differences typically does not provide enough detail to help instructors understand why some students seem to learn physics while solving problems and others do not. A critical issue is how students access the knowledge they have in the context of solving a particular problem. In this paper, we discuss our observations of students solving physics problems in authentic situations in an algebra-based physics class at the University of Maryland. We find that when these students are working together and interacting effectively, they often use a limited set of locally coherent resources for blocks of time of a few minutes or more. This coherence appears to provide the student with guidance as to what knowledge and procedures to access and what to ignore. Often, this leads to the students failing to apply relevant knowledge they later show they possess. In this paper, we outline a theoretical phenomenology for describing these local coherences and identify six organizational structures that we refer to as epistemic games. The hypothesis that students tend to function within the narrow confines of a fairly limited set of games provides a good description of our observations. We demonstrate how students use these games in two case studies and discuss the implications for instruction.},

  abstract = {Collaborative learning in computer-supported learning environments typically means that learners work on tasks together, discussing their individual perspectives via text-based media or videoconferencing, and consequently acquire knowledge. Collaborative learning, however, is often sub-optimal with respect to how learners work on the concepts that are supposed to be learned and how learners interact with each other. One possibility to improve collaborative learning environments is to conceptualize epistemic scripts, which specify how learners work on a given task, and social scripts, which structure how learners interact with each other. In this contribution, two studies will be reported that investigated the effects of epistemic and social scripts in a text-based computer-supported learning environment and in a videoconferencing learning environment in order to foster the individual acquisition of knowledge. In each study the factors `epistemic script' and `social script' have been independently varied in a 2 \texttimes{} 2-factorial design. A total of 182 university students of educational science participated in these two studies. Results of both studies show that social scripts can be substantially beneficial with respect to the individual acquisition of knowledge, whereas epistemic scripts apparently do not always lead to the expected effects.},

  abstract = {Analytical solutions for point and variance estimators of the mediated effect, the ratio of the mediated to the direct effect, and the proportion of the total effect that is mediated were studied with statistical simulations. We compared several approximate solutions based on the multivariate delta method and second order Taylor series expansions to the empirical standard deviation of each estimator and theoretical standard error when available. The simulations consisted of 500 replications of three normally distributed variables for eight sample sizes (N = 10, 25, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 5000) and 64 parameter value combinations. The different solutions for the standard error of the indirect effect were very similar for sample sizes of at least 50, except when the independent variable was dichotomized. A sample size of at least 500 was needed for accurate point and variance estimates of the proportion mediated. The point and variance estimates of the ratio of the mediated to nonmediated effect did not stabilize until the sample size was 2,000 for the all continuous variable case. Implications for the estimation of mediated effects in experimental and nonexperimental studies are discussed.},

Studies 1 and 2 varied the stereotype vulnerability of Black participants taking a difficult verbal test by varying whether or not their performance was ostensibly diagnostic of ability, and thus, whether or not they were at risk of fulfilling the racial stereotype about their intellectual ability. Reflecting the pressure of this vulnerability, Blacks underperformed in relation to Whites in the ability-diagnostic condition but not in the nondiagnostic condition (with Scholastic Aptitude Tests controlled). Study 3 validated that ability-diagnosticity cognitively activated the racial stereotype in these participants and motivated them not to conform to it, or to be judged by it. Study 4 showed that mere salience of the stereotype could impair Blacks' performance even when the test was not ability diagnostic. The role of stereotype vulnerability in the standardized test performance of ability-stigmatized groups is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Many students hold incorrect ideas and negative attitudes about computer science (CS). In order to address these difficulties, a series of learning activities called Computer Science Unplugged was developed by Tim Bell and his colleagues. These activities expose young people to central concepts in CS in an entertaining way without requiring a computer. The CS Unplugged activities have become more and more popular among CS educators and several activities are recommended in the ACM K-12 curriculum for elementary schools. CS Unplugged is used worldwide and has been translated into many languages. We examined the effect of the CS Unplugged activities on middle-school students' ideas about CS and their desire to consider and study it in high school. The results indicate that following the activities the ideas of the students on what CS is about were partially improved, but their desire to study CS lessened. In order to provide possible explanations to these results, we analyzed the CS Unplugged activities to determine to what extent the objectives of CS Unplugged were addressed in the activities. In addition, we checked whether the activities were designed according to constructivist principles and whether they were explicitly linked to central concepts in CS. We found that only some of the objectives were addressed in the activities, that the activities do not engage with the students' prior knowledge and that most of the activities are not explicitly linked to central concepts in CS. We offer suggestions for modifying the CS Unplugged activities so that they will be more likely to achieve their objectives.},

  abstract = {The ability to collect, store, and manage data is increasing quickly, but our ability to understand it remains constant. In an attempt to gain better understanding of data, fields such as information visualization, data mining and graphic design are employed, each solving an isolated part of the specific problem, but failing in a broader sense: there are too many unsolved problems in the visualization of complex data. As a solution, this dissertation proposes that the individual fields be brought together as part of a singular process titled Computational Information Design.
This dissertation first examines the individual pedagogies of design, information, and computation with a focus on how they support one another as parts of a combined methodology for the exploration, analysis, and representation of complex data. Next, in order to make the process accessible to a wider audience, a tool is introduced to simplify the computational process for beginners, and can be used as a sketch- ing platform by more advanced users. Finally, a series of examples show how the methodology and tool can be used to address a range of data problems, in particular, the human genome.},

  doi = {10.1145/571647.571649},
  abstract = {Treemaps, a space-filling method for visualizing large hierarchical data sets, are receiving increasing attention. Several algorithms have been previously proposed to create more useful displays by controlling the aspect ratios of the rectangles that make up a treemap. While these algorithms do improve visibility of small items in a single layout, they introduce instability over time in the display of dynamically changing data, fail to preserve order of the underlying data, and create layouts that are difficult to visually search. In addition, continuous treemap algorithms are not suitable for displaying fixed-sized objects within them, such as images.This paper introduces a new "strip" treemap algorithm which addresses these shortcomings, and analyzes other "pivot" algorithms we recently developed showing the trade-offs between them. These ordered treemap algorithms ensure that items near each other in the given order will be near each other in the treemap layout. Using experimental evidence from Monte Carlo trials and from actual stock market data, we show that, compared to other layout algorithms, ordered treemaps are more stable, while maintaining relatively favorable aspect ratios of the constituent rectangles. A user study with 20 participants clarifies the human performance benefits of the new algorithms. Finally, we present quantum treemap algorithms, which modify the layout of the continuous treemap algorithms to generate rectangles that are integral multiples of an input object size. The quantum treemap algorithm has been applied to PhotoMesa, an application that supports browsing of large numbers of images.},

As a result, when a designer is designing an object in an unfamiliar domain he will not have the same knowledge and skills available to him as when he is designing an object in a familiar domain. In this paper we look at the software designer's underlying constellation of knowledge and skills, and at the way in which this constellation is dependent upon experience in a domain. What skills drop out, what skills, or interactions of skills come forward as experience with the domain changes? To answer the above question, we studied expert designers in experimentally created design contexts with which they were differentially familiar. In this paper we describe the knowledge and skills we found were central to each of the above contexts and discuss the functional utility of each. In addition to discussing the knowledge and skills we observed in expert designers, we will also compare novice and expert behavior.},

In the present chapter, it is argued that when analyzing learning, one must consider the institutional character of the activities students are engaged in. Success and failure at learning in schools seem to have to do with mastering specific cultural forms of communication. The plea for multidisciplinarity is commendable, although Clancey's appeal to neuroscience for understanding how students grapple with scientific representations in class may be questioned. Meaning-making, interaction and learning about representational formats require that the object of inquiry retains its integrity as a human and collective practice of coping with and mastering ideas.},

  abstract = {Ideas like "understanding," "authenticity," and "community" are central in current debates about curriculum, instruction, and assessment. Many believe that teaching and learning would be improved if classrooms were organized to engage students in authentic tasks, guided by teachers with deep disciplinary understandings. Students would conjecture, experiment, and make arguments; they would frame and solve problems; and they would read, write, and create things that mattered to them. This article examines the challenge of creating classroom practices in the spirit of these ideals. With a window on her own teaching of elementary school mathematics, the author presents three dilemmas-of content, discourse, and community-that arise in trying to teach in ways that are, in Bruner's terms, "intellectually honest." These dilemmas arise reasonably from competing and worth-while aims and from the uncertainties inherent in striving to attain them. The article traces and explores the author's framing of and response to these dilemmas, providing a view of the pedagogical complexities that underlie current educational visions and the conditions needed to work toward them.},

It identifies simple, concrete, measures course designers and teachers can take to avoid these misconceptions arising. The context for this work centres on an introductory undergraduate course and a postgraduate course. Both these courses are taught by distance education. These courses both use Smalltalk as an introduction to object technology. More particularly, the undergraduate course uses Smalltalk as a first programming language.Distance education can limit the amount and speed of individual feedback that can be given in the early stages of learning. For this reason, particular attention has been paid to characterizing measures for avoiding elementary misconceptions seen in beginning learners. At the same time we also address some misconceptions observed in postgraduate students. The pedagogical issues discussed are of particular importance when devising an extended series of examples for teaching or assessment, or when designing a visual microworld to be used for teaching purposes.},

There is an extensive literature on testing, but very little that focuses on how testing is carried out in real-world circumstances. This is partly because current practices are often seen as unsophisticated and ineffective. We believe that by investigating and characterising the real-world work of testing we can help question why such `bad practices' occur and how improvements might be made. We also argue that the testing literature is too focused on technological issues when many of the problems, and indeed strengths, have as much do with work and organisation. In this paper we use empirical examples from four systems engineering projects to demonstrate how and in what ways testing is a cooperative activity. In particular we demonstrate the ways in which testing is situated within organisational work and satisfices organisational and marketplace demands.},

Transcripts of small group problem solving were analysed to determine how a collaborative zone of proximal development could be created through interaction between peers of comparable expertise, and to investigate conditions under which such interaction led to successful or unsuccessful problem solving outcomes. Unsuccessful problem solving was characterised by students' poor metacognitive decisions exacerbated by lack of critical engagement with each other's thinking, while successful outcomes were favoured if students challenged and discarded unhelpful ideas and actively endorsed useful strategies. In reconceptualising metacognition as a social practice, the study contributes to the growing body of research applying sociocultural theories to understand learning in mathematics classrooms.},

  title = {Selecting {{Criteria}} to {{Evaluate Qualitative Research}}},
  abstract = {While the evaluation of quantitative research frequently depends on judgements based on the ``holy trinity'' of objectivity, reliability and validity (Spencer, Ritchie, Lewis, \& Dillon, 2003, p. 59), applying these traditional criteria to qualitative research is not always a ``good fit'' (Schofield, 2002). Instead, educational researchers who engage in qualitative research have suggested various sets of alternative criteria including: transferability, generalisability, ontological authenticity, reciprocity, dependability, confirmability, reflexivity, fittingness, vitality and, even, sacredness and goodness (Creswell, 2002; Garman, 1996; Guba \& Lincoln, 1989; Patton, 2002; Spencer et al., 2003; Stige, Malterud, \& Midtgarden, 2009). While over one hundred sets of qualitative research criteria have been identified (Stige et al., 2009), some researchers warn against the absolute application of any criteria to qualitative research which is, by its nature, wide-ranging and varied, and does not necessarily lend itself to the straightforward application of any evaluation criteria. Nevertheless, whether or not criteria are applied at all in the research evaluation process, postgraduate students face a number of decisions associated with the process of evaluating qualitative research: 1) whether or not to adopt a set of appraisal criteria; 2) which criteria to select, if criteria are used; and 3) how to apply alternative approaches to criteria-focused evaluation. These decisions often require a paradigm shift (Khun, 1962) in the way postgraduate students perceive and approach their research. The messiness and complexity associated with such decisions can be confronting. This paper examines a number of approaches used by researchers to evaluate qualitative investigations in educational research.},

Using the concept of 'coloring epistemologies' as an index of such tensions, the essay argues for proliferation as an ontological and historical claim. What all of this might mean in the teaching of research in education is dealt with in a delineation of five aporias that are fruitful in helping students work against technical thought and method: aporias of objectivity, complicity, difference, interpretation, and legitimization. The essay concludes with a 'disjunctive affirmation' of multiple ways of going about educational research in terms of finding our way into a less comfortable social science full of stuck places and difficult philosophical issues of truth, interpretation and responsibility.},

Additionally, Faraday formed interpretations\textemdash{}and doubts critiquing them\textemdash{}that drew upon his extensive experience with magnetism's spatial behaviors. These two cases suggest that physics instruction could include opportunities for students' development of their own investigatory learning.},

The class of methods discussed here looks at processes of learning in fine-grained detail, through which a theoretical framework evolves rather than is merely applied. This class of methodological orientations to studying learning processes diverges from more common ones in several important ways: 1) Attention to diverse features of the learning interaction; 2) conducting a moment-by-moment analysis, zooming in on the fine details of the studied processes; 3) rather than proving or applying a theory, the objective is to make theoretical innovations, or to develop a "humble theory." The challenge of using such techniques is that, by their nature, they do not follow a strongly delineated procedure, especially not the usual sort of coding. This symposium attempts to begin addressing the methodological issues by reflecting on several cases of data analysis.},

This article presents an analysis of a conceptual change model for describing student learning by applying research on student motivation to the process of conceptual change. Four general motivational constructs (goals, values, self-efficacy, and control beliefs) are suggested as potential mediators of the process of conceptual change. In addition, there is a discussion of the role of classroom contextual factors as moderators of the relations between student motivation and conceptual change. The article highlights the theoretical difficulties of a cold, or overly rational, model of conceptual change that focuses only on student cognition without considering the ways in which students' motivational beliefs about themselves as learners and the roles of individuals in a classroom learning community can facilitate or hinder conceptual change.},

The research perspective used in this study is based on a co-constructive view of learning. Groups of three or four undergraduate mathematics majors, with prior experience writing mathematical proofs together, were asked to prove three statements. Computer software, such as Geometers Sketchpad, was available. Group work sessions were videotaped. Later, individuals viewed segments of the group video and were asked to reflect on group activities. Students in some groups did not share a common conception of proof, which seemed to hamper their collaboration. We observed interactions that fit with the co-constructive theory, with bidirectional interactions that shaped both group and individual conceptions of the tasks. These changes in understanding may result from parallel and successive internalization and externalization of ideas by individuals in a social context.},

  abstract = {Background Engineers who engage with innovation and design rely on cooperation and knowledge sharing across multiple disciplines. However, the traditional engineering curriculum promotes and emphasizes engineering sciences and monodisciplinary skills and gives less priority to important collaborative skills such as sketching and visualization. Purpose This article addresses how students engage with engineering design challenges and use visual representations to develop and integrate recognitions. Our study explores how technical, analytical disciplinary competences are combined with those of qualitative, ethnographic user studies. Design/Method Through a qualitative field study and an analysis of a collection of representations produced during a design process by a team of engineering students, the role of representations in the early stages of collaborative engineering design is explored. After reassembling the representations according to dates and themes, we deployed various perspectives from science and technology studies and engineering studies to assess the students' epistemic journey. Results Representations not only communicate findings but also incorporate analysis in their creation, and facilitate what we call collaborative design synthesis. Successful representations present and organize recognitions so that they are recognizable across other disciplines and can be integrated into new recognitions. Representations therefore shape the collaborative base of the design process and emphasize the important competences that can produce them. Conclusions The analysis shows that collaborative design synthesis is an epistemology consisting of (1) exploration, (2) inscription, (3) collection, and (4) combining and refining. The important ability of representations to draw together is termed transferability, and the competence to produce them, disciplinary mastery.},

  title = {How Differences in Interactions Affect Learning and Development of Design Expertise in the Context of Biomedical Engineering Design},
  abstract = {Authentic design commonly involves teams of designers collaborating on ill-structured problems over extended time periods. Nonetheless, design has been studied extensively in sequestered settings, limiting our understanding of design as process and especially of learning design process. This study addresses potential shortcomings of such studies by examining in-situ student team design. The participants of this study are three cohorts of a year-long capstone biomedical engineering design class at The University of Texas. Pilot research demonstrated advantages of a more authentic redesign task over a kit-based design task; students who chose devices to redesign were significantly better at representing perspective taking associated with customers' needs. Pilot research showed that there was no relationship between Early Efficiency (appropriate use of factual and conceptual knowledge) and Final Innovation of design products.                 I triangulated various methods for studying design: Qualitative research, Hierarchical Linear Modeling, and Social Network Analysis, the latter of which allowed me to generate team-level statistics of interaction (Cohesion), once I devised a practical method to account for missing data in a weighted network. Final Efficiency is a function of Early Innovation, early and late Cohesion, and team feasibility (factual and practical knowledge). Final Innovation is a function of Early Innovation, late Cohesion, and team Voice of the Customer (perspective-taking), with all relationships in both models positive. Measures of both design skills and interaction are required to explain variance in these outcomes.                 Narratives of team negotiation of design impasses--seemingly insurmountable barriers--provide deeper understanding of relationships between design process and products. The case study teams spent a large percentage of their time engaged in problem scoping, but framed as engineering science rather than as engineering design. Only when they began prototyping did they transition towards being solution focused and frame the problem as engineering design. This left little time for iteration of the final design. Variance in timing of iteration may account for slight deviations of the case study teams from the statistical model.                 Recommendations include earlier opportunities to design and support for team collaboration. Social network analysis is recommended when learning is interactional and to support triangulation.},

  title = {Students' Categorizations of Organic Compounds},
  volume = {9},
  abstract = {Categorization is a fundamental psychological ability necessary for problem solving and many other higher-level cognitive tasks. In organic chemistry, students must establish groupings of different chemical compounds in order not only to solve problems, but also to understand course content. Classic models of categorization emphasize similarity as the primary means of classification: if two items are similar, they belong in the same category and if they are dissimilar, they belong in different categories. These models also underscore a one-dimensional approach where a single salient feature is often used as the basis of categorization, even though multiple salient features may be present. This study examined the critical attribute organic chemistry students used to categorize eight organic compounds possessing similar salient features related to structure, functional groups, and stereochemistry and how this primary feature changed over time. Results from this study support the notion that the critical attribute is not stable, but changes as student learning progresses. The results also suggest that categorization is a systematic process involving conscious selection of the critical attribute and that higher-ability students (e.g., honor students) are more prone to be influenced by the current instructional topic when selecting the critical attribute.},

  abstract = {Background Interdisciplinary teamwork is increasingly important for engineering graduates. Yet, the reality of teaching interdisciplinarity requires faculty and students to navigate structures of engineering programs that do not accommodate interdisciplinary work. Purpose (Hypothesis) The purpose of this study is to understand how students and faculty negotiate interdisciplinary identities and how self-managed work teams can be used as a pedagogical strategy for promoting interdisciplinarity. Gee's concepts of affinity identity and institutional identity are used to theorize interdisciplinary teaming. Design/Method Multiple data sets from observations and interviews are used to present a case study of one interdisciplinary design course from the points of view of faculty and students. This approach, combined with research literature, is used to propose a pedagogical model for interdisciplinary teaming. Results A pedagogical approach of self-managed teaming can promote interdisciplinary identities if (a) faculty model institutional identities as interdisciplinary researchers and instructors, (b) students are encouraged to perform as decision-makers in groups constructed through affinity identities, and (c) faculty provide scaffolding for self-managed teams and encourage valuing of different disciplinary perspectives. Conclusions In the midst of an international shift toward interdisciplinarity, structural boundaries within academia present challenges to interdisciplinary collaborations. Gee's identity theory can facilitate our understanding of academic structures, especially in examining how overlapping affinity and institutional identities are at the center of newly formed interdisciplinary spaces. Issues critical to aiding interdisciplinary teaming include conflict management, scaffolding by instructors, and realistic appraisal of disciplinary grounding. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

  title = {Interactions between Affect and Cognition during Mathematical Problem-Solving: {{A}} Two-Year Case Study of Four Elementary School Children},
  shorttitle = {Interactions between Affect and Cognition during Mathematical Problem-Solving},
  abstract = {Through videotaped task-based clinical interviews, this study seeks to describe and explore the affect of four children in the context of mathematical problem solving. It focuses on inferring affective representations and pathways, how these interact with cognition during problem solving, and how they change over a two year span of time. Three highly structured interviews were administered to each child roughly one year apart. The children (two male, two female) were selected for in-depth analysis from twenty-two children in a larger study. The study was designed to be strictly exploratory and descriptive; its product is a set of qualitative case studies. Inferences of affect and cognition are based on verbal utterances and ejaculations, observable gestures, body movements and facial expressions, written calculations and other external representations constructed or manipulated, and periods of silence. While no claim is made for the reliability of the process of inferring affect, every effort has been made to be as explicit as possible in describing the basis for inferences drawn. The findings suggest a major, complex interplay of the affective domain with children's mathematical thinking. The system of affect appears to be an essential component in the development of mathematical understanding and problem solving ability. The complexity of this system includes the features that the most powerful affect is positive; that the problem solver discerns and regulates negative local affect to useful purpose; that affect frequently changes; it is in the control of the solver; it involves the construction of mathematical knowledge; there are important interactions between global and local affect; and the solver's affect interacts with a variety of external factors. The development of powerful affect needs to be an explicit goal in mathematics education. It should not be misunderstood as the experience of strictly positive emotions. If the mathematics education community hopes to truly achieve the goal of mathematics for all, educators must take the step of incorporating far more comprehensive models of knowing. This dissertation offers a preliminary sketch of a model for the affective domain, including ways to classify behaviors from which to infer affect, and ways to analyze these inferences.* ftn*Originally published in DAI vol. 57, no. 5.

will support itself vertically, a sufficiently long one will tend to

The theoretical model includes several related concepts that pertain to numerous interlocking and sequential elements of the total work. These include work processes, types of work, and interactional processes. The model avoids assuming a tightly integrated organization of work; rather, it represents an extension of the negotiated order approach to organizations. A discussion of variations in projects revolves around two important dimensions of projects. The article closes with a discussion of extreme disruptions in project work flow, as well as some general considerations about the importance of focusing on articulation in organizations.},

Five experiments examined whether people can also draw physical inferences by taking simulated actions. The basic experimental task involved 2 glasses of different widths but equal heights. People imagined that the glasses were filled to the same level with water and answered whether they would spill at the same or different angles. When asked explicitly, people were usually wrong; but, when they closed their eyes and tilted each glass until the imagined water reached the rim, they correctly tilted a narrow glass farther than a wide one. These experiments dissociated simulated actions from both propositional inferences and visual imagery. The results suggest a new emphasis on the role of motor activity in drawing inferences and address issues related to joining naive intuitions and explicit understandings.

One potential source of improvements in children's problem representations is learning new problem-solving strategies. Ninety-one 3rd- and 4th-grade students solved mathematical equivalence problems (e.g., 3 + 4 + 6 = 3 + \_\_) and completed a representation assessment in which they briefly viewed similar problems and either reconstructed each problem or identified it in a set of alternatives. Experimental groups then received a lesson about one or both of two solution strategies, the equalize strategy and the add-subtract strategy. A control group received no instruction. All children completed posttest assessments of representation and problem solving. Children taught the equalize strategy improved their problem representations more than those not taught it. This pattern did not hold for the add-subtract strategy. These results indicate that learning new strategies is one source of changes in problem representation. However, some strategies are more effective than others at promoting accurate problem representation.},

  abstract = {This article examines why cognitively oriented technology innovations, designed to foster deep thinking and learning, have not become widespread in K-12 schools. We argue a key reason is that most design-based research does not explicitly address systemic issues of usability, scalability and sustainability. This limitation must be overcome if research is to create usable knowledge that addresses the challenges confronting technology innovations when implemented in real-world school contexts. This is especially important in an era when political forces push schools away from the cognitively rich, inquiry-oriented approaches espoused by the Learning Sciences. We suggest expanding our conception of design-based research to include research on innovations in the context of systemic reform as a potential solution to the problem. To that end, we introduce research questions and issues arising from our own experiences with a technology-rich innovation in the context of a systemic reform initiative as a starting point in the creation of an expanded design-based research agenda. These questions and issues have important implications for both the continued viability of research on technologies for learning and on the future of technology use in schools that stems from such research.},

The EME is based on the tenets of self-determination theory and is composed of 28 items subdivided into seven sub-scales assessing three types of intrinsic motivation (intrinsic motivation to know, to accomplish things, and to experience stimulation), three types of extrinsic motivation (external, introjected, and identified regulation), and a motivation. The purpose of this investigation was to cross-culturally validate in English the EME. The EME was translated in English through appropriate methodological procedures and completed by university students. Results revealed that the English version of the scale renamed the Academic Motivation Scale (AMS), has satisfactory levels of internal consistency (mean alpha value = .81) and temporal stability over a one-month period (mean test-retest correlation = .79). In addition, results of a confirmatory factor analysis (LISREL) confirmed the seven-factor structure of the AMS. Finally, gender differences obtained with the EME were basically replicated with the AMS. In sum, the present findings provide adequate support for the factorial validity and reliability of the AMS and support its use in educational research on motivation.},

Today, even university curricula too often pay only lip service to the teaching of algorithmic fundamentals, reinforcing the popular belief that their place at the core of a software engineer's education is past. Yet even today, the importance of algorithms in software engineering has not diminished, and the effects of neglect are evident everywhere in needlessly inefficient industrial applications. The study of algorithms must regain its rightful place of central importance in the everyday work of today's practitioner.},

We hypothesize that achievement of mutual understanding also depends on participants having epistemological and conceptual framings that are sufficiently aligned. We distinguish between cases in which the participants achieved alignment of conceptual framing by adopting a schema that was in their common ground, cases in which the participants co-constructed a coherent framing without the benefit of a prefabricated schema (by constraint satisfaction, we hypothesize), and cases in which mutual understanding involved a refinement that did not require reframing.

In this article, student achievement data from six states are used to highlight differences in the demographic characteristics of schools identified as needing improvement and schools meeting the federal adequate yearly progress requirements. School-level data from Virginia and California are used to illustrate that these differences arise both from the selection bias inherent in using mean proficiency scores and from rules that require students in racially diverse schools to meet multiple performance targets. The authors suggest alternatives for the design of accountability systems that include using multiple measures of student achievement, factoring in student improvement on achievement tests in reading and mathematics, and incorporating state accountability ratings of school performance.},

Thinkable models are representations of things and processes simple enough that people can use them in thought experiments. The organization of cognitive structures for technical domains can be imagined to be a network of appropriately connected thinkable models. Artificial intelligence (AI), as the science of representations, has focused in the main on languagelike representations. If we can enrich our vision of representations to include a greater variety of ways of thinking that are useful to people, we may hope to broaden access to scientific ideas. To pursue these notions in some detail, a taxonomy of models is developed and the issue of how representations relate to human modes of perception and action is raised. The notions are explored first through contrasting of several approaches to the Pythagorean Theorem.$<$/p$>$},

Therefore, anthropologists should now pursue, without exaggerates hopes for the power of their texts to change the world, a variety of strategies for writing *against* culture.

We analyzed verbal protocols collected from two senior and two freshman engineering students. The four students exemplify the significant design activity findings from a previous study. In this paper, we present the results from the analysis of the four design protocols, focusing on the relationship between representation and design activity, and on differences between the freshmen and seniors in our sample in the way that they make and use design sketches. We discuss these findings with a focus on improving design education.},

However, topics often concentrate on computer history, codes of ethics and intellectual property, while neglecting broader issues of societal impact. This paper explores how these neglected topics can be better developed through a subtle change of focus to the significant role that ICT plays in addressing the needs of the community. Drawing on the survey and a set of implementation cases, the paper provides guidance by means of examples and resources to empower teaching teams to engage students in the application of ICT to bring about positive social outcomes -- computing for the social good.},

Second, articles are often published that treat interrater reliability solely as a matter of justifying the coding scheme, without further attention to the variance it makes evident in the process of coding. We argue that authors should not treat coding results as data but rather as tabulations of claims about data and that it is important to discuss the rates and substance of disagreements among coders. We propose publication guidelines for authors and reviewers of this form of research.},

  shorttitle = {Competencies {{Beyond Countries}}},
  abstract = {For over two centuries, the competencies that engineers have been expected to gain from engineering education have been associated with countries. Increased mobility in the workplace is generating pressure to expand competencies beyond countries. A key indicator of changing expectations is found in efforts by engineering education organizations to extend themselves beyond countries. This article compares the transformation of engineering education organizations in the United States with those in Europe and Latin America. In the U.S., organizations are attempting to expand directly from the country to the globe, relying upon prior acceptance of a redefinition of required competencies. In Europe, the redefinition of engineering competencies is taking longer to develop as participating organizations have worked first to define a new regional identity in terms of continental mobility and economic competitiveness. Finally, in Latin America, the redefinition of competencies awaits a resolution of a competition between alternative models of the region. This study of the expected competencies of engineers contributes to the research area of engineering epistemologies. Overall, the contemporary re-definition of competencies in engineering education is not a universal phenomenon but depends upon success in defining identities that extend beyond the country.

  abstract = {The study we describe here, an ethnographic investigation of the cognitive work of three programming teams, led us to emphasize an aspect of situatedness that is relatively unexplored: the developing perspective ofintellectual workers on their contexts of action. We followed teams composed of students in a Department of Computer Science as they were being taught ``software engineering.'' Despite their subordinate position as students, we found that the institution was not totally successful in dictating their work; we could not assume a similarity of work activity across teams. Instead the teams' perspectives on their projects were collectively developed over the course of the project and they diverged. Consequently, the teams differed in their construal of the objects of their intellectual work and in the significance and time they devoted to the components of their work, and to the ways in which they carried them out. In this paper we recount these differences and relate them ultimately to ongoing tensions and contradictions within, and external to, the university. ``Perspective,'' we argue, usefully extends the applicability of theories of situated cognition, especially activity theory, to the type of diversity we encountered.1},

We aimed to predict the effects of risk-factor trends on COPD, lung cancer, and tuberculosis.Methods$<$br/$>$We used representative data sources to estimate past trends in smoking and household solid-fuel use and to construct a range of future scenarios. We obtained the aetiological effects of risk factors on diseases from meta-analyses of epidemiological studies and from large studies in China. We modelled future COPD and lung cancer mortality and tuberculosis incidence, taking into account the accumulation of hazardous effects of risk factors on COPD and lung cancer over time, and dependency of the risk of tuberculosis infection on the prevalence of disease. We quantified the sensitivity of our results to methods and data choices.Findings$<$br/$>$If smoking and solid-fuel use remain at current levels between 2003 and 2033, 65 million deaths from COPD and 18 million deaths from lung cancer are predicted in China; 82\% of COPD deaths and 75\% of lung cancer deaths will be attributable to the combined effects of smoking and solid-fuel use. Complete gradual cessation of smoking and solid-fuel use by 2033 could avoid 26 million deaths from COPD and 6$\cdot$3 million deaths from lung cancer; interventions of intermediate magnitude would reduce deaths by 6-31\% (COPD) and 8-26\% (lung cancer). Complete cessation of smoking and solid-fuel use by 2033 would reduce the projected annual tuberculosis incidence in 2033 by 14-52\% if 80\% DOTS coverage is sustained, 27-62\% if 50\% coverage is sustained, or 33-71\% if 20\% coverage is sustained.Interpretation$<$br/$>$Reducing smoking and solid-fuel use can substantially lower predictions of COPD and lung cancer burden and would contribute to effective tuberculosis control in China.Funding$<$br/$>$International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease.$<$/p$>$},

  abstract = {In this paper we review the literature relating to the psychological/educational study of programming. We identify general trends comparing novice and expert programmers, programming knowledge and strategies, program generation and comprehension, and object-oriented versus procedural programming. (We do not cover research relating specifically to other programming styles.) The main focus of the review is on novice programming and topics relating to novice teaching and learning. Various problems experienced by novices are identified, including issues relating to basic program design, to algorithmic complexity in certain language features, to the ``fragility'' of novice knowledge, and so on. We summarise this material and suggest some practical implications for teachers. We suggest that a key issue that emerges is the distinction between effective and ineffective novices. What characterises effective novices? Is it possible to identify the specific deficits of ineffective novices and help them to become effective learners of programming?},

On the basis of historical research, ethnography, discourse analysis, and sociolinguistic interviews, the authors describe how a set of linguistic features that were once not noticed at all, then used and heard primarily as markers of socioeconomic class, have come to be linked increasingly to place and ``enregistered'' as a dialect called ``Pittsburghese.'' To explain how this has come about, the authors draw on the semiotic concept of ``orders of indexicality.'' They suggest that social and geographical mobility during the latter half of the twentieth century has played a crucial role in the process. They model a particularistic approach to linguistic and ideological change that is sensitive not only to ideas about language that circulate in the media but also to the life experiences of particular speakers; and they show how an understanding of linguistic variation, language attitudes, and the stylized performance of dialect is enhanced by exploring the historical and ideological processes that make resources for these practices available.},

In particular, the students learned (a) to distinguish equations that are true for any value of the independent variable from equations that constrain the independent variable to a unique value and (b) to solve the latter type of equation to determine when specific physical events occur. The analysis of how these understandings emerged led to two results. First, the analysis demonstrated that students have and can use criteria for evaluating algebraic representations. Second, the analysis led to a theoretical frame that explains how students can develop modeling knowledge by coordinating such criteria with knowledge for generating and using algebraic representations. The frame extends research on students' algebraic modeling, cognitive processes and structures for using mathematical representations, and the development of mathematical knowledge.},

The shift to a functional view of mind eliminates many difficulties with the entitative approach but elements of the latter persist in locating mind inside the head or brain. This creates many problems including inability to account for the collective creation of artifacts that no individual participant fully understands. Greeno attempts to deal with these issues by shifting a functional, symbol processing approach from the individual to the group level. This analysis focuses primarily on the interaction of external problem representations (knowledge) and participant status or authority (control). The resulting approach offers something new to theories of group problem-solving or learning but ignores individual learning and, in treating authority statically, does not live up to Greeno's initial goal of synthesizing cognitive and socio-linguistic theory.},

  abstract = {When nations redefine their priorities and re-plot their directions of travel, engineers get worried about the contents of their knowledge. The cultural and historical specificity of their responses illustrates the extent to which the questions of what counts as engineering knowledge and what counts as an engineer are linked tightly together, and also suggests that both may be tied to local images of the nation. After summarizing recent historical work comparing national patterns in engineering knowledge and engineers' work, this essay outlines how a focus on professional identity may provide a way of accounting for national and transnational influences on engineers while avoiding the specter of determinism. Offering brief case studies drawn from France, the UK, Germany and the USA, the authors describe engineers as 'responding' to codes of meaning that live at different scales, including contrasting metrics of progress and images of private industry. The paper is concluded with a brief assessment of some further implications of the analysis of professional identity for work in engineering studies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

  abstract = {SummaryBackground
Repeated periods of stimulation of the spinal cord and training increased the ability to control movement in animal models of spinal cord injury. We hypothesised that tonic epidural spinal cord stimulation can modulate spinal circuitry in human beings into a physiological state that enables sensory input from standing and stepping movements to serve as a source of neural control to undertake these tasks.
Methods
A 23-year-old man who had paraplegia from a C7\textendash{}T1 subluxation as a result of a motor vehicle accident in July 2006, presented with complete loss of clinically detectable voluntary motor function and partial preservation of sensation below the T1 cord segment. After 170 locomotor training sessions over 26 months, a 16-electrode array was surgically placed on the dura (L1\textendash{}S1 cord segments) in December 2009, to allow for chronic electrical stimulation. Spinal cord stimulation was done during sessions that lasted up to 250 min. We did 29 experiments and tested several stimulation combinations and parameters with the aim of the patient achieving standing and stepping.
Findings
Epidural stimulation enabled the man to achieve full weight-bearing standing with assistance provided only for balance for 4$\cdot$25 min. The patient achieved this standing during stimulation using parameters identified as specific for standing while providing bilateral load-bearing proprioceptive input. We also noted locomotor-like patterns when stimulation parameters were optimised for stepping. Additionally, 7 months after implantation, the patient recovered supraspinal control of some leg movements, but only during epidural stimulation.
Interpretation
Task-specific training with epidural stimulation might reactivate previously silent spared neural circuits or promote plasticity. These interventions could be a viable clinical approach for functional recovery after severe paralysis.

  volume = {40},
  doi = {10.1002/tea.10085},
  abstract = {Secondary school, undergraduate, and graduate level learners' mental models of bonding in ionic substances were explored using an interview protocol that involved the use of physical substances and a focus card containing depictions of ionic bonding and structure. Teachers and faculty from the teaching institutions were interviewed to contextualize teaching models within the educational setting for the inquiry. These data resulted in two socially negotiated consensus teaching models and a series of criterial attributes for these models: the essential qualities, all of which must be negotiated, if the model is used in a way that is acceptable to scientists. The secondary school learners see ionic bonding as consisting of attraction of oppositely charged species that arise from the transfer of electrons driven by the desire of atoms to obtain an octet of electrons. The undergraduates see the lattice structure as a key component of ionic substances and quickly identified specific ionic lattices for the physical prompts used as probes. The graduates also identified strongly with ionic lattices, were less likely to focus on particular ionic structures, and had a stronger appreciation for the notion of the ionic-covalent continuum. The research findings suggest that learners at all educational levels harbor a number of alternative conceptions and prefer to use simple mental models. These findings suggest that teachers and university faculty need to provide stronger links between the detailed nature of a model and its intended purpose. \dbend{} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Students must be able to think algorithmically, to create various algorithms, solving given problems, starting with easy ones and consecutively increasing their algorithmic knowledge and shifts during studies, to the level where they deeply understand much more complex algorithms. Several years ago, secondary-school-students were taught how to create basic algorithms and write them into a program language, e.g., Basic or Pascal. But recently the situation in our country has changed rapidly. The user's approach by students has been increasing, but the algorithmic approach is almost unknown to them. This was the reason why our faculty decided to change the curricula with regard to accepted students who have been coming to the faculty without any previous algorithmic knowledge. In the paper, we introduce our approach to the development of the students' algorithmic thinking.},

Such a datum gives us more information about the event under study than data gathered by any other sociological method. Participant observation can thus provide us with a yardstick against which to measure the completeness of data gathered in other ways, a model which can serve to let us know what orders of information escape us when we use other methods.},

Literature highlights argumentation as a critical epistemic practice for science and history learning (Duschl \& J. Osborne, 2002; National Research Council, 2007, 2012). Although there is ample support for argumentation in the teaching of history and science, the specific epistemic issues that students address through this practice are not always empirically documented. We draw on the work of Chinn, Buckland, and Samarapungavan (2011) to examine argumentation practices in science and history in 2 fifth-grade and 2 sixth-grade urban classrooms. Students' and teachers' emergent argumentation practices were coded and analyzed and epistemic reasoning was examined using the 5 components of the Chinn et al. model. Findings highlight that students engaged in complex argumentation practices that were consistent across classrooms. The classroom case examples demonstrate that students addressed all 5 epistemic components in the Chinn et al. model through their argumentation practice. Further research to better understand the relationship between teacher epistemic commitments, pedagogical practices, and student epistemic commitments and learning is suggested.},

Our data confirm that the initial positive results from the introduction of Workshops in organic chemistry and in biochemistry have been maintained over time and over changes in course instructor. In addition, training upper-level Workshop leaders has contributed substantially to the self-sustaining character of our program. These longitudinal results have been accompanied by the lateral spread of Workshops into other courses and departments. The concurrent development of mutually reinforcing partnerships among faculty, staff and students has supported these changes. Complementary adjustments in institutional practice, and the recent establishment here of a Center for Workshop Education now provide a formal framework to foster the continuing promise of our Workshop program.},

However, there are relatively few empirical studies on what takes place during this instruction, why this instruction is used, and how it affects students' learning. In this paper, I investigate these issues by examining a case study of one professor using this type of instruction in an introductory real analysis course. I first describe the professor's actions in the classroom and argue that these actions are the result of the professor's beliefs about mathematics, students, and education, as well as his knowledge of the material being covered. I then illustrate how the professor's teaching style influenced the way that his students attempted to learn the material. Finally, I discuss the implications that the reported data have on mathematics education research.},

The empirical basis of the research is a set of ethnographic records of two communities of amateur astronomers, as well as the details of astronomers' instantiations of the hobby. Hobbies are paradigmatic examples of interest-driven practices and thus they offer an excellent window into truly interest-related phenomena and processes. The analysis and data collection followed a grounded theoretical process, which I describe in two parts. First, I comb through the data iteratively and present a theory of persistent engagement in a hobby practice. Based on this theoretical sketch, I then explain how individuals' persistent, interest-based pursuit of amateur astronomy is made possible by 4 structural and process features of the practice, which together afford individuals the ability to continuously tailor the hobby: (a) an extensive and varied material infrastructure; (b) participating simultaneously across multiple communities/sites of astronomy practice; (c) activity structural resources that function as templates for short- and long-term activities; and (d) processes of collaboration and idea sharing. Lessons for the design of science learning environments that are truly interest-driven follow.},

Michael wondered if current is defined as moving charge and the ideal conductor is by definition neutral, how could one calculate the current through it? This question is thornier than it first appears. We will show how Michael's identity as a sense-maker, an identity defined in part by its oppositional relation to many aspects of Michael's engineering program, influences how he approaches this problem, and how his approach reinforces his identity.},

  abstract = {Science education reforms consistently maintain the goal that students develop an understanding of the nature of science, including both the nature of scientific knowledge and methods for making it. This paper articulates a framework for scaffolding epistemic aspects of inquiry that can help students understand inquiry processes in relation to the kinds of knowledge such processes can produce. This framework underlies the design of a technology-supported inquiry curriculum for evolution and natural selection that focuses students on constructing and evaluating scientific explanations for natural phenomena. The design has been refined through cycles of implementation, analysis, and revision that have documented the epistemic practices students engage in during inquiry, indicate ways in which designed tools support students' work, and suggest necessary additional social scaffolds. These findings suggest that epistemic tools can play a unique role in supporting students' inquiry, and a fruitful means for studying students' scientific epistemologies. \dbend{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this paper, we develop the notion of ``representational affordances'' to denote affordances provided by design representations to the designer as the ``user'' of these representations. A major characteristic of representational affordances is that they do not have to rely on existing representations but can drive the construction of new representations that may then afford different design actions. We describe representational affordances ontologically, proposing three affordance types: reflexive, reactive and reflective. We illustrate them with examples of analogy making and optimization.},

Since then, the notion of scaffolding has been applied more broadly, and it has been transformed and generalized. Most recently, it has been used by researchers in the learning sciences to describe features and functions of technological artifacts, especially those of educational software. In this article, we present an analytic framework that we believe can guide and systematize these new uses of the scaffolding metaphor. In this new framework, "scaffolds" are not features of artifacts or situations, nor is "scaffolding" something that may be occurring (or not) in a given situation that we observe. Rather, a scaffolding analysis is a kind of comparative analysis that we perform on learning interactions. Because this analysis is comparative, it always produces results that are relative to specific choices that we make in framing the comparative analysis. In this article, we present a theoretical argument for our proposed framework and illustrate the definition by applying it to two software environments.},

Instruction that leads to efficient transfer is important, but it can also promote what we call ``overzealous'' transfer (OZT), where people focus primarily on seeing the old in the new because old routines have been successful before. As a result, OZT can hinder opportunities for new learning, and this can further diminish adaptive transfer later on. We relate OZT to ``negative transfer,'' provide experimental examples of OZT, discuss how a number of professions have developed procedures for avoiding OZT, argue that many common approaches to instruction and assessment may inadvertently produce OZT, and suggest some implications for future research.},

  title = {Engineering as Lifestyle and a Meritocracy of Difficulty: {{Two}} Pervasive Beliefs among Engineering Students and Their Possible Effects},
  abstract = {In this paper we discuss a series of narratives collected from ethnographic interviews with engineering students concerning questions about what they wish to be an engineer. Our paper reports on two related beliefs that we have found among engineering undergraduates, most commonly in their first two years of four-year programs.	These are: engineering as a lifestyle and a meritocracy of difficulty. Engineering as a lifestyle refers to the anticipated comfortable life that students expect from their careers as engineers. In terms of a meritocracy of difficulty we are referring to how students' justify their anticipated comfortable futures based on the fact that they perceive their school work to be much more difficult than that of students in other departments. The reason that the difficulties of their engineering studies will merit them the comfortable material existence that comes from earning an engineering degree.	This paper's analysis is based on data from a comparative, four-year longitudinal study of undergraduate students' pathways through engineering degree programs at four engineering schools across the United States. Our analysis of engineering as a lifestyle focuses upon how little first and second year students know about the actual practices of engineers. In a similar vain, a meritocracy of difficulty also persists due to this lack of understanding, as such we argue that students construct reasons for their expected future prosperity that if they work harder now, they deserve more later.},

Student experience with introductory programming courses is of interest to the computing education community, especially due to continued decreases in enrollments in computing degree programs. In this study, we explore one direct approach to document students' initial attitudinal experiences with programming by asking them to complete an open-ended question at the end of a first programming course. Based on content-analysis of students' responses, we find that nearly 50\% of responses were positive in nature, there is significant difference in the responses of majors and non-majors, and that response characteristics correlate to earned grade in the course. We present preliminary, but inconclusive evidence on the impact of context (e.g., gaming or media computation) in a first programming course. Finally, we propose a multiple-choice question based on the most common student responses for large-scale deployment in computing courses and identify key contextual information that will inform future analysis of that data.},

  volume = {4},
  issn = {10986065},
  abstract = {In this article, we present a relational perspective in which cultural diversity is viewed as a relation between people's participation in the practices of different communities. In the case at hand, the relevant practices were those of students' local, home communities, and the broader communities to which they belonged in wider society on the one hand and the specifically mathematical practices established by the classroom community on the other hand. In the 1st part of the article, we discuss how we might characterize the practices of these various communities by drawing on Wenger's (1998) notion of a community of practice and on Gee's (1997) notion of a Discourse. In doing so, we question the manner in which students are frequently classified exclusively in terms of the standard categories of race and ethnicity in investigations of equity in mathematics education. Later in the article, we clarify that in addition to focusing on the continuities and contrasts between the practices of different communities, the relational perspective also encompasses issues of both power and identity. As we illustrate, the gatekeeping role that mathematics plays in students' access to educational and economic opportunities is not limited to differences in the ways of knowing associated with participation in the practices of different communities. Instead, it also includes difficulties that students experience in reconciling their views of themselves and who they want to become with the identities that they are invited to construct in the mathematics classroom.

Most attempts to theorize emotions, however, tend to reduce them to one side or the other of these dichotomies; anthropology is divided between views of the emotions as primarily biological and as primarily sociocultural in nature. In this article I consider these approaches and propose three ways around the meaning/feeling dichotomy: through a rereading of the intellectual past of the modern West; through analytic methods that seek to reconstruct affective resonances; and through a realization that feeling-tones, as well as meanings, are conveyed in the writing and reading of ethnography. In this article I draw on comparative material from the Central Himalayan region of Kumaon in northern India. [emotion, meaning, feeling, anthropological theory, South Asia, Himalaya]},

Although commonsense science has been the focus of substantial study for more than two decades, there are still profound disagreements about its nature and origin, and its role in science learning. What is the reason that it has been so difficult to reach consensus? We believe that the problems run deep; there are difficulties both with how the field has framed questions and the way that it has gone about seeking answers. In order to make progress, we believe it will be helpful to focus on one type of research instrument\textemdash{}the clinical interview\textemdash{}that is employed in the study of commonsense science. More specifically, we argue that we should seek to understand and model, on a moment-by-moment basis, student reasoning as it occurs in the interviews employed to study commonsense science. To illustrate and support this claim, we draw on a corpus of interviews with middle school students in which the students were asked questions pertaining to the seasons and climate phenomena. Our analysis of this corpus is based on what we call the mode-node framework. In this framework, student reasoning is seen as drawing on a set of knowledge elements we call nodes, and this set produces temporary explanatory structures we call dynamic mental constructs. Furthermore, the analysis of our corpus seeks to highlight certain patterns of student reasoning that occur during interviews, patterns in what we call conceptual dynamics. These include patterns in which students can be seen to search through available knowledge (nodes), in which they assemble nodes into an explanation, and in which they converge on and shift among alternative explanations. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Three different lenses (instrumentation, humans-with-media, multimodality) are used to analyse some classroom activities, where students employ such new technologies. It is also shown how the multi-representations present in the two technological environments can support the students' multimodal production, interaction, and communication, when they are engaged in constructing mathematical meanings.

This article analyzes 178 published studies in the WS literature covering the following areas: 1) General intelligence, 2) Language skills, 3) Visuospatial and face processing skills, 4) Behavior patterns and hypersociability, 5) Musical abilities, and 6) Brain structure and function. We identify methodological issues relating to small sample size, use and type of control groups, and multiple measures of task performance. Previously described 'peaks' within the cognitive profile are closely examined to assess their veracity. This review highlights the need for methodologically sound studies that utilize multiple comparison groups, developmental trajectories, and longitudinal analyses to examine the WS phenotype, as well as those that link brain structure and function to the cognitive and behavioral phenotype of WS individuals.},

What was once understood by cognitive scientists as the accumulated mental contents of an individual, shaped by the struggle to solve problems in well-defined task environments, has given way to a much broader set of approaches in the learning sciences. In this commentary, researchers argue that two of these approaches--domain specificity and distributed cognition--have dramatically altered the terrain for research in the learning sciences. Many psychologists study the mind without asking what it was designed to do. Instead, they hope to uncover its structure by studying things it is capable of doing. Playing chess, remembering nonsense syllables or long strings of numbers, programming computers, doing college-level statistics--these are all activities that we can do.},

A case of teaching and learning about exponents derived from lessons taught in the project is described and interpreted from mathematical, pedagogical, and sociolinguistic perspectives. To change the meaning of knowing and learning in school, the teacher initiated and supported social interactions appropriate to making mathematical arguments in response to students' conjectures. The activities students engaged in as they asserted and examined hypotheses about the mathematical structures that underlie their solutions to problems are contrasted with the conventional activities that characterize school mathematics.},

The current approach to building program execution and debugging environments is to use exclusively visual stimuli on programming languages whose syntax and semantics has often been designed without empirical guidance. We present an alternative: Sodbeans, an open-source integrated development environment designed to output carefully chosen spoken auditory cues to supplement empirically evaluated visual stimuli. Originally designed for the blind, earlier work suggested that Sodbeans may benefit sighted programmers as well. We evaluate Sodbeans in two experiments. First, we report on a formal debugging experiment comparing (1) a visual debugger, (2) an auditory debugger, and (3) a multimedia debugger, which includes both visual and auditory stimuli. The results from this study indicate that while auditory debuggers on their own are significantly less effective for sighted users when compared with visual and multimedia debuggers, multimedia debuggers might benefit sighted programmers under certain circumstances. Specifically, we found that while multimedia debuggers do not provide instant usability, once programmers have some practice, their performance in answering comprehension questions improves. Second, we created and evaluated a pilot survey analyzing individual elements in a custom programming language (called HOP) to garner empirical metrics on their comprehensibility. Results showed that some of the most widely used syntax and semantics choices in commercial programming languages are extraordinarily unintuitive for novices. For example, at an aggregate level, the word for , as in a for loop, was rated reliably worse than repeat by more than 673\% by novices. After completing our studies, we implemented the HOP programming language and integrated it into Sodbeans.},

  doi = {10.1080/10508400709336941},
  abstract = {Abstract Over the last decade, researchers have become increasingly interested in students' beliefs about the nature of knowledge and how these beliefs develop. Although initial psychological accounts portrayed epistemic development as a domain-independent process of cognitive maturation, recent studies have found trajectories of epistemic development to vary considerably across contexts. However, few studies have focused on cultural context. This article examines the role community values and practices play in fostering particular epistemological orientations by comparing the epistemological beliefs of 5th, 8th, and 12th graders (N = 200) from General and Religious schools in Israel regarding 2 controversies: belief in God and punishment of children. In both controversies, older participants were less likely than younger participants to consider the controversy rationally decidable. However, this shift emerged earlier in the God controversy than in the punishment controversy. In the God controversy, General pupils were less likely than Religious pupils to consider the question rationally decidable or their own beliefs infallible. But no such school differences were observed in the punishment controversy. Qualitative and quantitative analyses linked these differences to divergent discourse practices at General and Religious schools, suggesting that the relations between learning and epistemic development are more intricate than has been assumed hitherto. Epistemology is an area of philosophy concerned with questions of what knowledge is and how it is justified. Although few people give these questions such detailed and sustained attention as professional philosophers, anyone attempting to acquire, produce, or evaluate knowledge relies, at least implicitly, on some set of epistemological beliefs. Such beliefs are of obvious interest to educators. To understand how students acquire, evaluate, and justify knowledge, we need to understand what they consider knowledge to be. And to help students become discerning consumers and responsible producers of knowledge, we need to understand how people learn to exercise reflective judgment in the face of competing claims. The psychological study of epistemic development is undergoing something of a renaissance. Interest in this area can be traced back to Piaget (1970), Dewey (1933), and beyond (e.g., Plato's Theaetetus). But only recently have psychologists begun to draw together hitherto disparate strands of empirical inquiry to chart in detail the course of epistemic development from infancy to adulthood (see, e.g., Hallett, Chandler, \& Krettenauer, 2002; Kuhn, Cheney, \& Weinstock, 2000; Wainryb, Shaw, Langley, Cottam, \& Lewis, 2004). Initial research in this field was conducted largely within a neo-Piagetian paradigm. Epistemic development was characterized as a progression through discrete stages or levels of epistemological understanding, each following the other in invariant sequence and constituting a comprehensive transformation of the individual's conception of knowledge (see, e.g., Chandler, 1975; Kitchener \& King, 1981; Perry, 1970). Researchers differed somewhat in their nomenclatures and in their criteria for distinguishing levels of epistemological sophistication, but they concurred broadly in positing at least two major shifts in epistemological understanding (for recent reviews, see Hofer \& Pintrich, 1997, 2002). Initially, the individual subscribes to an objectivist conception of knowledge, in which every question is believed to have a single, correct answer that is knowable with absolute certainty. Subsequently, in a radical shift, objectivism is abandoned in favor of subjectivism, and the individual equates all knowledge claims with matters of personal taste or preference. Finally, a balance is achieved in which objective and subjective aspects of knowing are coordinated. At this ``evaluativist'' stage (cf. Kuhn, 1991), the individual sees knowledge as something that is constructed tentatively by evaluating the evidence for and against competing beliefs and points of view. There was some debate about the precise relations of these stages to Piaget's stages of intellectual development (see, e.g., Boyes \& Chandler, 1992). However, they were viewed by most researchers as a kind of ``post-formal operations'' taking up the formal operational attainments of hypothetical thinking and perspective-taking and applying them wholesale to knowledge claims as such, in a form of meta-metacognition (see, e.g., Kitchener, 1983; Kuhn, 2000; Moshman, 2003). Empirical support for this model of epistemic development came from several parallel research programs. Overall, these studies provided substantial evidence of development in the hypothesized direction (Hallett et al., 2002; Hofer \& Pintrich, 1997; King \& Kitchener, 1994). However, the ages at which the key shifts in epistemological understanding were observed varied enormously from program to program. As Hallett et al. (2002) noted regarding the emergence of subjectivism, ``one could read selectively from the literature and, with good reason, conclude that such abilities put in their appearance at either 4 or 6 or 8 or 12 or 16 or 20, or in receipt of a Ph.D.'' (p. 289). These vast discrepancies have led researchers to reexamine some of the assump-tions underlying their models and measures of epistemic development. In particular, researchers have begun to question the comprehensiveness of shifts in epistemological understanding and to attend more closely to the variety of contexts within which epistemic beliefs are held, employed, and articulated (cf.Elby\&Ham-mer, 2001; Hammer\&Elby, 2002, 2003). This attention to context has taken several forms. One line of research has sought to show that epistemic development is a some-what domain-dependent process that occurs with respect to some kinds of knowledge claim before others. For example, it has been proposed that subjectivism emerges in relation to aesthetic claims before it emerges in relation to claims about the physical world (e.g., Hallett et al., 2002; Kuhn et al., 2000; Wainryb et al., 2004). Another line of research has sought to show that epistemological beliefs are multi di-mensional rather than unitary. For example, it has been proposed that people's beliefs about the complexity of knowledge develop more or less independently of their beliefs about its certainty (e.g., Schommer, 1990, 1993). Although the accumulated empirical evidence is as yet suggestive rather than conclusive (see Elby\&Hammer, 2001; Hallett et al., 2002, pp. 303\textendash{}304; Kuhn et al., 2000, pp. 321\textendash{}322), both research programs hold out the possibility of disentangling the course of epistemic de-velopment by identifying elements of epistemological understanding that emerge at different points in the lifespan(cf.Hallett et al.,2002, p. 290; Wainryb et al. 2004). However, ``domains'' and ``dimensions'' are not the only contexts within which epistemic beliefs are situated. Just as people's epistemic beliefs may be affected by the particular content of the knowledge claims being evaluated, so too may they be affected by the particular procedures of knowledge evaluation practiced in, and sanctioned by, the communities in which they participate (cf. Hammer \& Elby, 2003). Few studies have directly examined cross-cultural variation in epistemological beliefs. And those that have done so have tended to focus on comparisons between U.S. and East Asian college students (e.g., Chan \& Elliott, 2002, 2004; Nisbett, Peng, Choi, \& Norenzayan, 2001; Zhang, 1999). Nonetheless, the findings of such studies are highly suggestive. Especially striking is Zhang's finding that Chinese students' epistemological beliefs shifted over the college years in exactly the opposite direction to those of their U.S. counterparts. Specifically, rather than moving from objectivist to subjectivist conceptions of knowledge, similar to their peers at U.S. universities, Chinese students appeared to shift from more subjectivist conceptions of knowledge to more objectivist ones. Such findings raise intriguing questions about the relations between culture and epistemic development, and about the relations between learning and epistemic development more generally. For a field of inquiry dominated by educational psychologists, remarkably little is known about these relations. As Hofer and Pintrich(1997) noted, ``there is little empirical evidence for precisely what fosters epistemological development or how epistemological beliefs are altered'' (p. 123). Research has shown that schooling makes a difference(e.g. Bell\&Linn, 2002; King\&Kitchener, 1994), but it has yielded little insight into how or why it makes a difference. Moreover, researchers have tended to equivocate between viewing epistemological beliefs as causes and effects of learning\textemdash{}as age-dependent constraints on instruction on one hand andasoutcomesof instructionon the other hand (cf. Kuhn, 1991, 2003; Schommer, 1990, 1993). Cross-cultural studies of age trends in epistemological belief are one way to investigate systematically the relations between age, learning, and epistemic development. If the nature and timing of age-related shifts in epistemological belief vary cross-culturally, then this is presumably because participants in different cultures learn, through participation in practices particular to their respective communities, to treat knowledge claims in different ways. To the extent that researchers can pinpoint such practices and measure their impact on individuals' epistemological beliefs, we can begin to characterize more precisely the relations between learning and epistemic development. However, in designing such studies, researchers must take great care to distinguish between reportage and editorial. ``Development'' is a value-laden term. Theoretical models of psychological development do more than describe a sequence; they attach values to different points along the sequence. Specifically, they define some psychological states or capacities as more mature, adequate, or sophisticated than others. When developmental studies are restricted to homogeneous cultural settings, within which there is little serious disagreement among experts about the relative adequacy of different psychological states or capacities, the risk of bias in diagnosing participants' levels of development is relatively slight. However, as the cultural heterogeneity of the sample increases, so too does the risk that the model on the basis of which participants' development is diagnosed is ethnocentrically biased against a portion of the sample. For example, beliefs that are defined as immature by the developmental model might be considered mature within one of the cultures from which the sample is drawn, or vice versa. These dangers exist to some extent in all cross-cultural studies of psychological development (see Cole \& Scribner, 1974; Greenfield \& Bruner, 1966; Shweder, Mahapatra, \& Miller, 1990). However, in cross-cultural studies of epistemic development the danger is even more clear and present. This is because there are at least four levels at which epistemological judgments can be made, and as one ascends from the first level to the fourth, the value assumptions implicit in these judgments become less visible to the naked eye but never quite disappear. At the first, most basic level, there arejudgments about the epistemic status of par-ticular claims, such as whether a given assertion (e.g., ``Eating people is wrong'') is known or merely believed (e.g., ``John doesn't know that eating people is wrong; he merely believes that eating people is wrong''). At one level of abstraction up from such judgments, there are judgments about the epistemic status of general classes of claim, such as judgments about whether knowledge is possible about, say, matters of aesthetics or morality (e.g., ``There are no such things as moral truths or moral knowledge; morality is a question of commitment\textemdash{}not of what is or is not the case''). At yet another level of abstraction up from such judgments, there are further judgments about the criteria by which epistemic states are distinguished one from another, such as judgments about what differentiates knowledge from belief or opin-ion (e.g., ``Knowledge is justified true belief;if a belief is true but not justified, or jus-tified but not true, then it isn't known''). And beyond this third level, there is a fourth level of judgments about the relative adequacy of particular criteria for distinguishing between epistemic states, such as judgments about whether the subjectivist equation of knowledge with opinion is less adequate than the evaluativist's insistence that knowledge differs from opinion in being supported by evidence (e.g., ``Subjectivism is inferior to evaluativism because it fails to account for our belief that some claims are better supported than others''). According to this analysis, authors of contemporary models of epistemic development are themselves exercising a form of epistemological judgment in articulating their models. Specifically, they are operating at the fourth level (outlined previously), expressing their own beliefs about the relative adequacy of particular epistemological orientations. This is all well and good as long as the beliefs in question are compatible with the epistemological beliefs, values, and practices of the communities to which the model is applied. However, in cross-cultural studies of epistemic development, such compatibility cannot be assumed in advance of the investigation itself. Accordingly, if one wishes to avoid ethnocentrism, one cannot conduct a cross-cultural study of epistemic development without suspending, at least temporarily, one's hierarchical assumptions about the relative adequacy of particular epistemological orientations. This is not to say that researchers are not entitled to opinions of their own about the relative adequacy of particular epistemological beliefs or that all talk of epistemic development is inherently ethnocentric. It is merely to point out that because standards of epistemological maturity may themselves vary across cultures, assumptions about the relative adequacy of particular epistemological beliefs must not be built into the design of cross-cultural studies. This study, therefore, departs from previous studies of epistemic development by dropping the assumption that some epistemological beliefs are inherently more adequate than others. By dropping this assumption, I do not affirm the contrary assumption that all epistemological beliefs are equally adequate. Rather, I adopt a form of methodological agnosticism to reduce the scope for ethnocentric bias in the study'sdesign. In the Discussion section, I return to the question of hierarchy and review the assumptions of contemporary models of epistemic development in light of my findings. This study investigates the relations between age, learning, and epistemic devel-opment by comparing the epistemological beliefs of pupil sat Religious schools and General schools in Israel about two controversies: one religious and the other nonre-ligious. Specifically, this study asks three questions. First, how do beliefs about the nature of religious claims vary with age and school? Second, to what extent are these age and school differences attributable to underlying group differences in religious commitment and general epistemological sophistication? Third, how are variations in epistemological belief across ages, schools, and controversies related to educational practices at Religious and General schools, respectively?},

  abstract = {In this article, we analyze interactive processes through which research groups and their statistical advisors insert new (for researchers) statistical concepts into existing research practice. Through processes of talk-in-interaction (speaking, gesture, and inscription), they assemble specimens, research workers, devices, algorithms, and texts, in alternative representations of future work. Alternate assemblies are compared, edited, and projected into future activity, in clients' projects and in publications, where they are viewed over a longer project history. As achievements of local interaction, assemblies have an interactive structure that builds from, and contrasts with, accounts of historically prior practice, involves joint imagination of new combinations of human judgment, with technology (e.g., statistical algorithms), and includes deliberate efforts to evaluate and edit future work activity. Speakers animate orders of work as laminar, narrative structures that deploy time, place, and human/technical agency in consequentially different ways. These alternative assemblies are produced during conversations in which client research projects have been disrupted or suspended in the hope of finding a better way to work in the future. In this sense, learning about new technical concepts that will be realized at a collective level of analysis is anticipated and given structure in local processes of interaction. We conclude with a discussion of how technical concepts are extended in scope and meaning as they are distributed through work organization. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {This paper discusses conceptions of identity in relation to science education and presents material from a series of interviews and focus groups with graduate students in science and technology. Given difficulties in retention and levels of significant participation by minority students indicated by aggregate data, the issue of race, as it informs critical interactions at a majority research university, is explored in terms of its effects on identity formation. It is argued that we need to look at ldquoreal-timerdquo science to see how subtle interactions affect minority graduate students. These interactions reveal how identity is established through the positioning inside or outside of the laboratory culture. Three themes were explored regarding the tensions of identity formation in the context of race and science education: (1) the issue of isolation, marginalization, and invisibility; (2) being valued through recognition of one's contributions to the community of scientists; and (3) reading race as an additional burden for minority students. Two participants' stories and their positioning as outsiders are explored in detail. The authors contrast building an identity as a scientist through one's educational experiences against being positioned as the ldquoonly onerdquo representing his or her race at a primarily White institution. \dbend{} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The focus of these questions include general troubleshooting, bug location, exploring unfamiliar environments, and describing students' real life troubleshooting experiences. We find that the common sense experience of students related to debugging is often at odds with the needs for debugging programs. Student troubleshooting experiences recognize real world non-determinism and rarely require undoing an attempted fix. Based on student answers, we shed light on some specific frustrations of instructors and make a set of recommendations for teaching, including addressing the difference between finding an error and fixing it, modeling the formation of multiple hypotheses, and encouraging students to apply domain knowledge.

But the main themes of the original essay are still valid \textendash{} the tendency persists (and may even have grown stronger) for individuals to charge their opponents indiscriminately with being ``positivists'' without being clear what actually characterizes this position; and there is still a failure to recognize that positivism was a complex ``position'' some of whose theses can be held by individuals who strongly oppose other theses and thus often do not deserve this label.

  abstract = {Knowing is a situated activity. Adopting a practice-based approach, this article describes a workplace characterized by technologically dense practices as a setting in which human actors and technological objects work "together." The case of remote cardiological consultation is paradigmatic of how information and communication technologies (ICT) enter workplaces and reshape them as "systems of fragmented knowledge:" that is, learning settings in which people, symbols, and technologies work jointly to construct and reconstruct understanding of social and organizational action. Working at a distance, therefore, requires the acquisition of skills relative to the mobilization of fragmented knowledge, and the latter's alignment into a fully-fledged work practice. Knowing-in-practice is accomplished by discursive practices: Framing and postscripting, as practices that generate a "space" of signification for the subsequent action; footing, as the dialectic that enables people to align themselves within a predetermined frame and disrupt its coordinates; and delegation to the nonhuman, as the ability of humans to delegate the performance of clinical practice to nonhuman systems, which come to be regarded as active subjects within the remote consultation [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  title = {Granovagg: Graphical Analysis of Variance Using Ggplot2},
  abstract = {This collection of functions in granovaGG
    provides what we call elemental graphics for display of
    anova results. The term elemental derives from the fact
    that each function is aimed at construction of
    graphical displays that afford direct visualizations of
    data with respect to the fundamental questions that
    drive the particular anova methods. This package
    represents a modification of the original granova
    package; the key change is to use ggplot2, Hadley
    Wickham's package based on Grammar of Graphics concepts
    (due to Wilkinson). The main function is granovagg.1w
    (a graphic for one way anova); two other functions
    (granovagg.ds and granovagg.contr) are to construct
    graphics for dependent sample analyses and
    contrast-based analyses respectively. (The function
    granova.2w, which entails dynamic displays of data, is
    not currently part of granovaGG.) The granovaGG
    functions are to display data for any number of groups,
    regardless of their sizes (however, very large data
    sets or numbers of groups can be problematic). For
    granovagg.1w a specialized approach is used to
    construct data-based contrast vectors for which anova
    data are displayed. The result is that the graphics use
    a straight line to facilitate clear interpretations
    while being faithful to the standard effect test in
    anova. The graphic results are complementary to
    standard summary tables; indeed, numerical summary
    statistics are provided as side effects of the graphic
    constructions. granovagg.ds and granovagg.contr provide
    graphic displays and numerical outputs for a dependent
    sample and contrast-based analyses. The graphics based
    on these functions can be especially helpful for
    learning how the respective methods work to answer the
    basic question(s) that drive the analyses. This means
    they can be particularly helpful for students and
    non-statistician analysts. But these methods can be of
    assistance for work-a-day applications of many kinds,
    as they can help to identify outliers, clusters or
    patterns, as well as highlight the role of non-linear
    transformations of data. In the case of granovagg.1w
    and granovagg.ds several arguments are provided to
    facilitate flexibility in the construction of graphics
    that accommodate diverse features of data, according to
    their corresponding display requirements. See the help
    files for individual functions.},

The research questions driving this study were: (1) Can experiences with discipline-based computing promote students' acquisition and application of foundational computing concepts and procedures? (2) How do students perceive and experience the integration of discipline-based computing as relevant to their future career goals? (3) How do students perceive the structure of the class as useful and engaging for their learning? We used qualitative and quantitative research methods to approach the research questions. The population studied was 20 engineering undergraduates from Johns Hopkins University. Results of this study suggest that students performed proficiently in applying computing methods, procedures, and concepts to the solution of well-structured engineering problems. Results also suggest that student self-perceptions of their overall computing abilities and their abilities to specifically solve engineering problems shifted from low to high confidence. Students consistently found the course to be important and useful for their studies and their future careers. They also found the course to be of very high quality and identified the instructors and the teaching and feedback methods employed as very useful for their learning. Finally, students also described the course as very challenging compared with other courses in their own department and at the university in general.},

  abstract = {Engineers need a breadth of experience to enrich the gene pool of ideas from which elegant engineering solutions can be drawn, called "individual diversity." While performing large ethnographic research studies where hundreds of engineering students were interviewed, we interviewed Inez, a student that epitomizes individual diversity. Inez is unlike most engineers: she is female, multi-minority, and from a socio-economically disadvantaged background. Inez's story is told here using "ethnography of the particular," where the story of a single individual is explored. Inez has persevered through challenges posed by her lack of familiarity with the culture of engineering, her weak high school preparation, and her feelings of being an outsider in engineering. Inez's story demonstrates that the playing field in engineering is still not level, particularly for socio-economically disadvantaged students. Her story provides a poignant example of the impact of five of Conefrey's cultural myths of science. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

In engineering education, identity has been cited as central in student development, for example, as a key factor in retention of students in the discipline. This paper examines how identity relates to students' decisions about whether to remain in or switch out of engineering majors. We develop case studies of two students, both women and both members of underrepresented minority groups. One successfully gained admittance into her desired major, and one is considering leaving engineering. We argue that while each woman takes a different position on what engineering education should offer, both display a common, and we argue troubling, view of this educational experience. Our analysis seeks to explicate our ethnographic methods and to explore the broader possible significance for engineering education of the views that these women hold.},

The affective states described are not global attitudes or traits, but local changing states of feeling that the solver experiences and can utilize during problem solving-to store and provide useful information, facilitate monitoring, and evoke heuristic processes. Thus affect, like language, is seen as fundamentally representational as well as communicative. Two major affective pathways-one favorable and one unfavorable-are discussed, together with conjectured relationships between affective states and useful or counterproductive heuristic configurations. Implications of the model include local affective goals for mathematics teaching related to problem-solving heuristics. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Although continued study is needed of external factors such as curricular requirements, admissions criteria, and test scores, we also need to know much more about the relationships between curricular experiences and students' learning styles, habits, and attitudes. The work presented in this paper was designed to enhance educators' understanding of the factors that underlie the concern about student retention in engineering. By observing 1,000 engineering students during their first three years in college, the research team generated a large database on the students' academic and non-academic characteristics as well as their successes and failures. The traits discovered not only support many findings from previous studies but also reveal some new relation- ships that could prove essential to designing an educational environment that will prepare engineers for success in the future.

We present a psychological model that explains how a certain class of errors in programs comes about. The model fits quite well with the results of a small sample of students and problems. The problems that underlie these and other errors seem to be (a) the complexity of the Prolog primitives (unification and backtracking) and (b) the misfit between students' naive solutions to a problem and the constructs that are available in Prolog (e.g. iterative solutions do not map easily to recursive programs). This suggests that learning Prolog could be helped by (1) coherent and detailed instruction about how Prolog works, (2) emphasis on finding recursive solutions that do not rely on primitives such as assignment and (3) instruction in programming techniques that allow students to implement procedural solutions.},

  abstract = {While engineering students are required to complete a number of mathematics courses, some engineering students and practitioners believe that they do not use the mathematics that they learned from their courses in engineering projects. This study investigates engineering students' use of mathematics through observations of two teams of students working on extensive design projects. The case studies presented in this chapter provide insights into situations when engineering students engage in modeling behavior and also explore ambiguity and precision in engineering design. These insights can inform engineering education as we help engineering students become more aware of the ways that mathematics is used in engineering. Additionally, understanding the ways that mathematics and mathematical thinking is used in professional applications can help us motivate and contextualize mathematics instruction as well as determine what should be taught to students in both college and pre-college settings.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the potential involvement of ``epistemic uncertainty'' in~mediating between complex design requirements and strategic switches in software design strategies. The analysis revealed that the designers produced an initial ``first-pass'' solution to the given design brief in a breadth-first manner, with this solution addressing several easy-to-handle requirements. The designers then focused on adding relatively complex-to-handle requirements to this initial solution in what appeared to be a depth-first manner, as reflected, for example, by detailed mental simulations that spanned many transcript segments. Furthermore, such depth-first development of complex requirements was linked to increases in epistemic uncertainty, a finding that supports the predicted role of uncertainty in mediating between complex requirements and depth-first design. Overall these findings support a view of software design as involving a mixed breadth-first and depth-first solution development approach, with strategic switching to depth-first design being triggered by requirement complexity and being mediated by associated feelings of uncertainty.},

While all the 16 participating students obtained the dielectric function correctly in one of two equivalent expressions, roughly half of them (7 of 16) failed to compute the roots correctly. All seven took the same initial step that led them to the incorrect answer. We note a perfect correlation between the specific expression of dielectric function obtained and the student's success in solving for the roots. We analyze student responses in terms of a resources framework and suggest routes for future research.},

  abstract = {Abstract  We describe the ``somatic marker hypothesis'' proposed by Damasio (1996) to account for the ability of most people to make decisions quickly and continually in the course of their lives. We relate this hypothesis to two other theoretical constructs, emotional orientations and purposes, which we have used in our research on students' reasoning and teachers' decision making. Given that somatic markers are a part of unconscious mental activity, they cannot be observed by introspective reflection. How then can we research something we cannot see? Beginning with the hypothesis that somatic markers influence actions, we observe, particularly, the actions of student teachers, teachers and children in mathematics classrooms at points where they make decisions. This process is illustrated through examples both of teaching and learning in mathematics, and through the account (see Op't Eynde and Hannula, this issue) of `Frank' reflecting on his decision-making in mathematical activity. We use the case of Frank to illustrate some differences between viewing mathematical activity from our perspective and from those of some other contributors to this special issue. The connections between emotional orientations, somatic markers and purposes are further illustrated by two examples drawn from our research into teacher development and students' reasoning processes.},

The theory of technical systems is applied in the development of the model to transform a graduating pre-university pupil into a university-trained engineer. Two co-aligned themes are identified as the executive system and the execution system, which dictate who and what will do the work and how the work will be completed, respectively. The model is an extension of an existing model and further depicts the duality of the pre-university pupil as an operator and as the operand as related to engineering education. Consequently, the proposed model details the student perspective from the bottom-up in an implicit manner and the top-down perspective from administrators and professors in an explicit manner. The model's utility is in providing a means by which to coordinate efforts of pre-college and university-level educational sectors in the production of entry-level engineers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Workplace engineering problems are substantively different from the kinds of problems that engineering students most often solve in the classroom; therefore, learning to solve classroom problems does not necessarily prepare engineering students to solve workplace problems. These qualitative studies of workplace engineering problems identify the attributes of workplace problems. Workplace problems are ill-structured and complex because they possess conflicting goals, multiple solution methods, non-engineering success standards, non-engineering constraints, unanticipated problems, distributed knowledge, collaborative activity systems, the importance of experience, and multiple forms of problem representation. Some implications for designing engineering curricula and experiences that better prepare students for solving workplace problems are considered. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

A total of 623 pupils enrolled in 13 Italian schools (Grades 5, 7, and 9) were asked to choose the operation needed to solve 26 multiplication and division word problems. Violations by the numerical data of the constraints imposed by the assumed tacit models (for instance, when the operator was a decimal number) constituted particular sources of difficulty at all three grade levels. The findings seemed to confirm the impact of the repeated addition model on multiplication and of the partitive model on division. The quotative division model influenced the pupils' choices only at the ninth-grade level.},

  abstract = {We are now witnessing the rapid growth of decentralized source code management (DSCM) systems, in which every developer has her own repository. DSCMs facilitate a style of collaboration in which work output can flow sideways (and privately) between collaborators, rather than always up and down (and publicly) via a central repository. Decentralization comes with both the promise of new data and the peril of its misinterpretation. We focus on git, a very popular DSCM used in high-profile projects. Decentralization, and other features of git, such as automatically recorded contributor attribution, lead to richer content histories, giving rise to new questions such as ldquoHow do contributions flow between developers to the official project repository?rdquo However, there are pitfalls. Commits may be reordered, deleted, or edited as they move between repositories. The semantics of terms common to SCMs and DSCMs sometimes differ markedly, potentially creating confusion. For example, a commit is immediately visible to all developers in centralized SCMs, but not in DSCMs. Our goal is to help researchers interested in DSCMs avoid these and other perils when mining and analyzing git data.},

It is also a domain where systems are used to try to help the developers coordinate their work. This paper describes the results of an empirical study of the use of one such system, a configuration management tool. Specifically it describes three aspects of the support that the tool provides: the challenges of representing the work, the need to support both individuals and groups working together, and how the assumptions about software development built into the tool interact with others in the organization. The study suggests that long after the initial adoption the tool and the organization continue to interact with each other. It also opens up questions for empirical studies of the organizational context behind the tool usage.},

I propose considering concepts for categorization as a special case of concepts. At their clearest, they can be referred to as formal concepts, or concepts used formally,which have explicit definitions and are used in formal deductive reasoning and argumentation. A label for broader aggregations of concepts is functional concepts, or concepts used functionally. This distinction is nearly parallel to Vygotsky's (1934/1987) distinction between scientific concepts and everyday concepts. Formal (uses of) concepts are important products and resources in subject matter disciplines, especially in science and mathematics. I suggest that the distinction between formal and functional (uses of) concepts can support a useful interpretation and organizing frame for efforts to provide meaningful instruction in disciplinary domains.},

This chapter argues that studies of learning, as situated in interaction, have suffered from inadequate theorizing concerning the nature of interaction itself. The chapter begins with a brief overview of the sixty year intellectual history of an ``interaction revolution'' that parallels the ``cognitive revolution'' reviewed by McDermott in his chapter. Special attention is given to the perspective developed through the pioneering ``Natural History of an Interview'' (NHI) research group whose work began in 1956\textendash{}the first to have studied both verbal and nonverbal aspects of social interaction together in an attempt at a unified analysis\textendash{}and its successors in an approach called ``context analysis.'' The chapter continues by documenting the patterns of reference to specific video examples that are apparent in the major papers and commentaries on them that appear in this volume. Reference to video examples differed markedly across authors, both in the particular strips of interaction that were chosen for purposes of illustration and in the ways those strips were discussed across the various chapters, suggesting that the affordances of the video corpus that was made available to authors were not fully taken advantage of in the discussions the authors produced. The chapter concludes by revisiting the need for better theorizing concerning the nature of social interaction itself, as a foundation for attempts to understand learning and teaching as an interactionally situated process.},

Whatis novel is that, more than previous work, I take seriously the possibility that a programming language can function as the principle representational system for physics instruction. This means treating programming as potentially having a similar status and performing a similar function to algebraic notation in physics learning. In order to address the implications of replacing the usual notational system with programming, I begin with two informal conjectures: (1) Programming-based representations might be easier for students to understand than equation-based representations, and (2) programming-based representations might privilege a somewhat different ``intuitive vocabulary.'' If the second conjecture is correct, it means that the nature of the understanding associated with programming-physics might be fundamentally different than the understanding associated with algebra-physics.},

For minorities, the biggest detrimental effects on dropout behavior were derived from pull factors in the form of family responsibilities and working off-campus. No significant positive effects from informal and formal interactions with faculty, close personal relationships with peers, and academic experiences during their first year in college were found to negate the large negative influences from the pull factors.

This article represents a tutorial on F/OSS that tries objectively to identify and present open source software's concepts, benefits, and challenges. From our point of view, F/OSS is more than just software. We conceptualize it as an IPO system that consists of the license as the boundary of the system, the community that provides the input, the development process, and the software as the output. After describing the evolution and definition of F/OSS, we identify three approaches to benefiting from F/OSS that center on (1) the software, (2) the community, and (3) the license respectively. Each approach is fit for a specific situation and provides a unique set of benefits and challenges. We further illustrate our points by refuting common misconceptions associated with F/OSS based upon our conceptual framework.},

Answers to these questions largely depend on the research tradition one selects, and on the main issues driving the research (e.g. theory? problems?). Often, we are unable to determine the initial impetus of a research project, because researchers usually present finished polished results and say little about the ways in which the projects started and developed. This paper is an attempt to uncover the often messy early stages of several research studies driven by didactical problems. Some of these projects were successfully completed, some are in progress and others are just starting and may end up stillborn. This paper presents a classification of the possible points of departure of research studies, a discussion of some heuristics, which may be helpful when choosing and pursuing research, and an analysis of some examples, including some methodological issues.$<$/p$>$},

This article explains and corrects these misunderstandings one by one and concludes with the Kuhnian insight that a scientific discipline without a large number of thoroughly executed case studies is a discipline without systematic production of exemplars, and a discipline without exemplars is an ineffective one. Social science may be strengthened by the execution of a greater number of good case studies.},

The theory of technical systems is applied in the development of the model to transform a graduating pre-university pupil into a university-trained engineer. Two co-aligned themes are identified as the executive system and the execution system, which dictate who and what will do the work and how the work will be completed, respectively. The model is an extension of an existing model and further depicts the duality of the pre-university pupil as an operator and as the operand as related to engineering education. Consequently, the proposed model details the student perspective from the bottom-up in an implicit manner and the top-down perspective from administrators and professors in an explicit manner. The model's utility is in providing a means by which to coordinate efforts of pre-college and university-level educational sectors in the production of entry-level engineers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Sense-making and satisficing processes determine when the transfer cycle begins and ends, and the classical mechanisms of transfer (identical rules, analogy, knowledge compilation, and constraint violation) are triggered under different representations of context. We use this framework to interpret student transfer behaviors with examples from the literature in the domains of physics and mathematics. We view this framework as a research tool to explore the dynamic nature and complexity of transfer by highlighting critical features and issues that a complete model of transfer must address. We describe how the framework relates to the classical and recent alternative approaches to understanding transfer and discuss the implications for theory development and instruction.},

Key areas of emphasis in DICE are cross-platform operation, support for projects that integrate heterogeneous programming languages, and support for applying and integrating different kinds of design and testing methodologies. The package is being developed at the University of Maryland to facilitate the research and teaching of methods for implementation, testing, evolution, and revision of engineering software. The platform- and language-independent focus of DICE makes it an effective vehicle for teaching high-productivity, high-reliability methods for design and implementation of embedded systems for a variety of courses. In this paper, we provide an overview of features of DICE --- particularly as they relate to testing driven design practices --- that are useful in embedded systems education, and discuss examples and experiences of applying the tool in courses at the University of Maryland aimed at diverse groups of students --- undergraduate programming concepts for engineers, graduate VLSI architectures (aimed at research-oriented students), and graduate FPGA system design (aimed at professional Master's students).},

We repeated the experiment with students in an introductory economics course, and again with a sub-population of the CS1 students after ten weeks of Java instruction.We found that a majority of beginning computing students could describe a coherent algorithm to correctly sort a list of numbers, while less than a third of general college students could do so. Many students gave versions of selection or insertion sort, but the most common algorithm treated numbers as strings and manipulated them digit by digit. Students who used iteration strongly preferred post-test loops. Finally, some aspects of student performance became worse after ten weeks of CS1 instruction.},

CS educators and educational researchers often refer to difficulties in learning recursion, and suggest methods for teaching recursion. However, the research literature barely addresses the unique ways in which students relate to this interdisciplinary concept and the particular learners' language concerning recursive phenomena. The gap is most apparent when seen through a constructivist lens, where the students' prior knowledge and idiosyncratic conceptions should be referred to and reflected upon in order to serve as a basis for further knowledge construction. This paper reports on a study in which a collaborative classification of several recursive phenomena is used to facilitate the construction of recursion. The students' discourse was analyzed, as a step toward understanding the students' ways of speaking recursively. Preliminary results indicate some basic aspects of recursion in the student discourse, although the students apparently talk a very different language from that of the experts, as used by books and teachers.},

  abstract = {Background Increasingly, modern engineers are designing miniature devices that integrate complex activities, actions, processes, or operations involving many steps, persons, and equipment; a good example is a microfluidic lab-on-a-chip device. The design of such devices is cognitively demanding and requires the generation of multiple model representations, which are used in an iterative fashion to analyze and improve prototype designs. Purpose This study addresses two questions: How are various representations and prototypes used in the iterative design and building of a microfluidic lab-on-a-chip device in a systems biology laboratory? In this design process, what cognitive functions did the representations serve? Design/Method This case study employed mixed methods. We utilized the standard ethnographic methods of participant observation, open-ended interviewing of participants, and artifact collection in an integrated systems biology research lab. Data were analyzed using open and axial coding. We also used cognitive-historical analysis to collect and analyze data from traditional historical sources (publications, grant proposals, laboratory notebooks, and technological artifacts) to recover how the salient representational, methodological, and reasoning practices were developed and used by the researchers. Results The device design involved complex interactions among mental models, computational models, and building and testing prototypes; tagging and visualizations were used to query and validate the prototypes as well as the computational models; all these were integrated to meet stringent experimental and fabrication constraints. Integration takes place across many different kinds of representations. The building of external representations helped not just to off-load cognitive load but also to add detail and constraints to the mental model. Conclusions Representational fluency and flexibility are required to manage the complexity of modern bioengineered devices. To support the development of such fluency and flexibility, engineering students must understand the function and the use of such representations, an instructional goal that has implication for new models of learning.},

The review also analyzes the nature of learning in terms of intuitions and misconceptions, and the plausible approaches to teaching through sequences, explanations, and examples. The topic is significant because of (a) the increased recognition of the organizing power of the concept of functions from middle school mathematics through more advanced topics in high school and college, and (b) the symbolic connections that represent potentials for increased understanding between graphical and algebraic worlds. This is a review of a specific part of the mathematics subject matter and how it is learned and may be taught; this specificity reflects the issues raised by recent theoretical research concerning how specific context and content contribute to learning and meaning.},

  abstract = {The development of an engineering curriculum assumes a body of knowledge that students, as future engineers, will need to know. Students acquire this body of knowledge through lectures, laboratories, projects and assignments and other means. The question then arises, how does one select the content and processes that are appropriate for the engineering education? What might be the consequences of these choices? Mary Shelley's Frankenstein presents a tale showing some of the possible consequences of poor choices in teaching content and process. In Shelley's novel, the `monster' finds himself caught between two worlds, one comprised of humans and the other of animals. In this allegory, the engineer is caught between the two worlds of science and art. The purpose of this allegory is to demonstrate how engineers, by accepting the body of knowledge presented to them without questioning the underlying values and assumptions, may find themselves embracing an oppressive ideology and developing an unhealthy identity. Consequently, engineering programs must provide forums where students are not only allowed but encouraged to critique the hidden values and assumptions contained in the programme content and process.

The Studying Professional Software Design workshop studied three pairs of professional software designers sketching designs for a traffic signal simulator. A discussion of the design space for the simulation task shows how this design space enables comparison of the designs. It also illustrates the benefits of explicitly considering the design space during design and the risks of failing to do so.},

Almost all faculty (87.1\%) indicated familiarity with one or more RBIS and approximately half of faculty (48.1\%) said that they currently use at least one RBIS. Results also indicate that faculty rarely use RBIS as recommended by the developer, but instead commonly make significant modifications.},

  volume = {9},
  abstract = {Many students perform extraction experiments without connecting relevant molecular features to corresponding macroscopic features. Two versions of an Organic Extraction Simulation, one with text captions and the other with narration accompanying the animation, were developed based on a cognitive view of multimedia learning. This instructional module was intended to help students to visualize extraction concepts at the molecular level, and to connect these concepts with corresponding macroscopic procedure. Organic Chemistry I students (N = 106) were randomly assigned to use one of two versions of the simulation (with text or narration). They completed a spatial ability test, and a pre-test and a post-test on organic extraction concepts. Post-test scores for both versions were significantly higher than pre-test scores. MANCOVA with a pre-test score covariate indicated that simulation version had a significant effect on lower-order cognitive questions (p = 0.036), while spatial ability was significantly correlated with higher-order cognitive questions (p = 0.004). Students in the narration group had significantly more positive attitudes towards the effectiveness of the simulation than did those in the text group.},

A new tool called mobility agreement was introduced to facilitate the inclusion of regular mobility exercises in home care visits and in the daily lives of the clients. Our analysis starts with an overview of those visits in 2008 and 2009. We then analyze in detail one visit conducted in 2011, after two years of implementation of the mobility agreement. The analysis brings together the dialectical principle of ascending from the abstract to the concrete with the help of a germ cell, and key ideas from embodied and enactive cognition. During the visits a new concept of mobility began to emerge in the simple movement of standing up from the chair. This new concept transcends and overcomes the contradiction between safety and autonomy. Also it embeds and integrates mobility into necessary everyday actions of the old person. It is accomplished jointly with the nurse and relying on often innovative uses of everyday household artifacts. Finally, the new concept frames physical mobility in terms of sustainability.},

  abstract = {Computer-mediated discussion forums (such as newsgroups or those in instructional management software environments) are becoming common in higher education. Such forums are interesting because they are not only one of the easiest technologies to add to a class but may also provide an important learning opportunity for students. However, simply making a discussion forum available does not mean that it will be used effectively to enable learning. In this paper, we explore the idea that specific features of a discussion forum may increase the likelihood of effective discussions taking place within the forum. We define effective discussions as those that are sustained and are focused on topics related to class learning goals. We then describe the specifications for an electronic discussion forum-a computer-mediated anchored discussion forum-that we propose makes sustained on-topic discussion more likely. We report on the results of two studies that support this proposal. We end by exploring implications for research into computer-supported discussion tools for learning and their design.

However, the large number and diversity of these alternative conceptions makes it difficult for teachers to identify any patterns in their students' thinking. A thorough analysis of alternative conceptions in chemistry, as described in the research literature in science and chemistry education, has led to the development of an explanatory framework that encompasses many of the ideas held by chemistry students about chemical substances and phenomena. Research results provided here indicate that many students' conceptual difficulties result from commonsense reasoning. This commonsense approach is based upon a set of assumptions about the natural world and the application of reasoning heuristics that students instinctively follow and apply without hesitating or considering other alternatives. The identification of this explanatory framework may provide a useful model that teachers can use to better understand and even predict many of their students' learning difficulties.},

This article examines three aspects of Dewey's Pragmatist philosophy as intellectual roots for current work in situated cognition. These aspects are used to organize a case analysis of two teachers working together to solve and design instruction for a typical algebra problem. The analysis focuses on interactional phenomena and argues that these phenomena are usually left out of studies of cognition and that they are critically important for understanding effective teaching. A close analysis of interaction supports a view of representation as shared activity, as an alternative to traditional cognitive accounts that focus exclusively on an individual's mental structures. In the moment-to-moment production and explanation of inferences about the mathematical structure of a problem, representations are activities in which these teachers are jointly engaged, rather than things that they individually have. Interpreting representation as a shared activity extends Dewey's cartography as a basis for studying mathematical experience and teaching.},

We present an overview of traditional and more contemporary epistemological stances from philosophical perspectives to offer another basis from which to examine this issue. Explicit examples of academic domains are described and epistemological comparisons are made based on our synthesized definition. Given the epistemological similarities and differences across domains that we identified from empirical and philosophical considerations, we propose that beliefs are both domain general and domain specific. Accordingly, we present a theoretical framework of personal epistemology that incorporates both positions and hypothesize how the belief systems might interact in terms of the development of personal epistemology and relations to various facets of cognition, motivation, and achievement. The article ends with a discussion of educational implications.},

The assessment revealed that scaffolds designed to elicit contextual, conceptual, or procedural knowledge each improved students' ability to add and subtract fractions. Analyses of errors and strategies along with cognitive modeling suggested potential mechanisms underlying these effects. In Phase 2, we designed an intervention based on scaffolding this prior knowledge and implemented the computer-based lessons in mathematics classes. In Phase 3, we used the DFA and supporting analyses to assess student learning from the intervention. The posttest results suggest that scaffolding conceptual, contextual, and procedural knowledge are promising tools for improving student learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

The introduced concepts of self-system and self-system process stress the importance of self-appraisals of personal competence and agency in affective responses and self-regulation in problem solving. Students are viewed as agents who constantly interpret and evaluate their experiences and regulate their behaviour, in interaction with their mathematics learning environment. This perspective is used to interpret two data sets: Finnish secondary school students' questionnaire responses and their mathematics achievement, and Frank's problem solving episode. The former study examines statistical relations between self-confidence, positive and negative affective responses, self-regulatory patterns, and math performance. The latter focuses on Frank's appraisals and self-regulatory processes with his affective responses while problem solving. Finally, I consider the perspective's usefulness and compare it others in this Special Issue.},

We human beings have bodies. We are "rational animals," but we are also "rational animals," which means that our rationality is embodied. The centrality of human embodiment directly influences what and how things can be meaningful for us, the ways in which these meanings can be developed and articulated, the ways we are able to comprehend and reason about our experience, and the actions we take. Our reality is shaped by the patterns of our bodily movement, the contours of our spatial and temporal orientation, and the forms of our interaction with objects. It is never merely a matter of abstract conceptualizations and propositional judgments. (Johnson, 1987, p. xix)
A "voice" emerges somehow, somewhere in that brain before us. It mostly talks to itself (and what does that mean?). It narrates his life story. It is the voice of Neil. He didn't have it when he was born, but he was telling stories by the age of four and his inner voice was full blown before he reached his fifth birthday. How did he create it?

The authors' main claim is that learning may be thought of as closing the gap between actual identity and designated identity, two sets of reifying significant stories about the learner that are also endorsed by the learner. Empirical illustration comes from a study in which the mathematical learning practices of a group of 17-year-old immigrant students from the former Soviet Union, newly arrived in Israel, were compared with those of native Israelis.},

It further investigates what conceptual resources students use, and in what ways they use them, to construct explanatory models, and the obstacles preventing them from constructing a useful explanatory model. Our findings indicate that several of the children were able to construct explanatory models. However, of the six children interviewed multiple times (three third-graders and three sixth-graders), only one was consistently able to critique and revise her models to arrive at a consistent, coherent, and sophisticated explanatory model. Connecting intuitive knowledge and abstract knowledge was important in her construction of a coherent and sophisticated explanatory model. Students who relied only on intuitive knowledge constructed tentative and non-sophisticated explanatory models. Students who relied only on verbal-symbolic knowledge at an abstract level without connection with their intuition also did not construct coherent and sophisticated models. These results indicate that instruction should help students to become meta-conceptually aware and connect their verbal-symbolic knowledge and intuition in order to construct explanatory models to make sense of abstract scientific knowledge.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of the cross-cultural aspects of personal epistemology is limited. In particular, cross-cultural comparisons of elementary school teachers' and students' personal epistemology have received very little theoretical or empirical attention. The current chapter aims to examine German and U.S. elementary schools in terms of their philosophical and practical similarities and differences in personal epistemology. Both theoretical and empirical work will be reviewed to support a more holistic model of personal epistemology, the Educational Model of Personal Epistemology (Haerle, 2006). In light of this model, we discuss our expectations for differences and similarities in the epistemic climate of elementary classrooms in the U.S. and Germany. Drawing from this discussion, we suggest that researchers should approach cross-cultural research in personal epistemology from a more holistic standpoint, employ a diversity of methods, and obtain a solid understanding of the educational context under study. Regarding educational implications, we propose a possible fusion of the educational philosophies held in the U.S. and Germany concerning the implementation of teacher training and classroom education. Finally, we recommend that fostering evaluativistic thinking (i.e., a way of knowing that focuses on the evaluation and decision-making among differing viewpoints) should be a main goal for education starting at the elementary level to ensure students' future roles as productive citizens in Western societies and stress the role of the teacher in this endeavor.},

Rather than hide the underlying scenegraph within a toolkit-specific abstraction, D3 enables direct inspection and manipulation of a native representation: the standard document object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development. Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements over intermediate representations.},

In Experiment 2, students were instructed to read either to determine the comprehensibility of passage information or to teach passage information. Then students read a statistical passage, assessed their understanding, and completed a mastery test and study strategy inventory. Regression analyses indicated that the less students believed in simple knowledge, the better they performed on the mastery test and the more accurately they assessed their comprehension. A path model indicates that study strategies may mediate epistemological effects.},

Similarly, during problem solving, students profiled as both rational and empirical had the highest frequency of regulation
of cognition compared to students profiled as empirical or rational. Finally, students profiled as both rational and empirical
attained higher levels of problem-solving achievement compared to students profiled as empirical.},

The learning environment incorporates games set in the context of a Newtonian computer microworld, where students have to control the motion of a spaceship in order to achieve goals such as hitting a target or navigating a maze. The purpose of the games is to focus the students' attention on various aspects of the implications of Newton's laws. A set of general design principles guided the design of the games and microworld. These include: (I) represent the phenomena of the domain clearly; (2) eliminate irrelevant complexities from the computer microworld; (3) focus the students on as peers of their knowledge.that need revising; (4) facilitate the use of problem-solving heuristics; (5) encourage the application of relevant knowledge from other domains; and (6) encourage better ways of representing and thinking about the domain. A controlled study indicated that playing the games improved the students' ability to solve dynamics problems. The students utilized various components of their knowledge, including their intuitions concerning how forces affect motion and their partial understanding of the formal physics, to generate strategies for the games. The use of such knowledge is combined with the use of general problem-solving heuristics and feedback from the computer microworld to facilitate the evolution of the students' knowledge of Newtonian dynamics. An examination of the results in light of the original design principles suggested numerous improvements that could be made to the sequence of games and microworld. The design process could best be characterized as a series of successive refinements.},

In this randomized double-blind study, 399 students either wrote about their most important values or not, twice at the beginning of the 15-week course. Values affirmation reduced the male-female performance and learning difference substantially and elevated women's modal grades from the C to B range. Benefits were strongest for women who tended to endorse the stereotype that men do better than women in physics.

Participatory simulations plunge learners into life-sized, computer-supported simulations, creating new paths to scientific understanding. By wearing small, communicating computers called Thinking Tags, students are transformed into players in a large-scale microworld. Like classic microworlds, participatory simulations create a scenario, mediated by a set of underlying rules, that enables inquiry and experimentation. In addition, these new activities allow students to "dive into" a learning environment and directly engage with the complex system at hand. This article describes and analyzes a set of participatory simulations that were conducted with a group of high school biology students. The students' experiences are tracked from their initial encounter with an immersive simulation through their exploration of the system and final description of its underlying rules. The article explores the educational potential of participatory simulations. The results of this pilot study suggest an opportunity to further investigate the role that personal experience can play in developing inquiry skills and scientific understanding.},

This article presents a cognitive architecture that uses cue-based search to model multiple design strategies including procedural, functional, means-end or focal, and opportunistic design. The model has been implemented in an artificial intelligence (AI) system that generates Pascal programs from English specifications.
Knowledge is represented as nodes that reside in internal or external memory, where a node encodes an action that may range from a line of code to a routine in size. A program is built by linking nodes through a search cue of the form $<$role, goal, object$>$. The cue is broadcast to memory, and any matching node is returned; the cue provides a question to ask, and the return provides the answer. A cue on the newly linked node is then selected as a new focus, and the search process repeated. Each design strategy defines a specific node visiting order that traverses the program structure through its links.},

  abstract = {Modeling is a core practice in science and a central part of scientific literacy. We present theoretical and empirical motivation for a learning progression for scientific modeling that aims to make the practice accessible and meaningful for learners. We define scientific modeling as including the elements of the practice (constructing, using, evaluating, and revising scientific models) and the metaknowledge that guides and motivates the practice (e.g., understanding the nature and purpose of models). Our learning progression for scientific modeling includes two dimensions that combine metaknowledge and elements of practice~-~scientific models as tools for predicting and explaining, and models change as understanding improves. We describe levels of progress along these two dimensions of our progression and illustrate them with classroom examples from 5th and 6th graders engaged in modeling. Our illustrations indicate that both groups of learners productively engaged in constructing and revising increasingly accurate models that included powerful explanatory mechanisms, and applied these models to make predictions for closely related phenomena. Furthermore, we show how students engaged in modeling practices move along levels of this progression. In particular, students moved from illustrative to explanatory models, and developed increasingly sophisticated views of the explanatory nature of models, shifting from models as correct or incorrect to models as encompassing explanations for multiple aspects of a target phenomenon. They also developed more nuanced reasons to revise models. Finally, we present challenges for learners in modeling practices~-~such as understanding how constructing a model can aid their own sensemaking, and seeing model building as a way to generate new knowledge rather than represent what they have already learned. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Prior to this study, we completed a first cycle of design revisions to a game-based ecological sciences curriculum to make more apparent specific domain concepts associated with targeted learning standards. Of particular interest was using gaming principles to embed standards-based science concepts in the curricular experience without undermining the situative embodiment central to our design philosophy. In Study One reported here, the same first-cycle elementary teacher used the refined second-cycle curriculum, again with high-ability fourth graders. We then analyzed qualitative and quantitative data on student participation and performance to further refine our theory and revise the curriculum. In Study Two, another teacher implemented a further refined second-cycle curriculum with lower achieving fourth graders, including several students labeled as having special needs. We use the design trajectory and results to illustrate and warrant the creation of a situationally embodied curriculum that supports the learning of specific disciplinary formalisms.  \dbend{} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Another major component of these reform efforts is the creation of opportunities for students to communicate within and about mathematics. The ability to generalize, especially when the generalization requires a major breakthrough in habits of mind, is one indication of algebraic reasoning. In this article, I describe generalization activity as an opportunity to learn about seventh graders' understanding of functions. A group of students who had studied functions modeled a multivariable situation. Through individual and group work, they designed, described, and discussed various representations for functions of 2 variables. Their modeling efforts allowed them to analyze their understanding of representations of quantities, relationships among quantities, and relationships among the representations of quantities in both single- and multivariable functions.},

  abstract = {There has been much interest in using software tools to scaffold learners in complex tasks, that is, to provide supports that enable students to deal with more complex content and skill demands than they could otherwise handle. Many different approaches to scaffolding techniques have been presented in a broad range of software tools. I argue that two complementary mechanisms can explain how a diversity of scaffolding approaches in software act to support learners. Software tools can help structure the learning task, guiding learners through key components and supporting their planning and performance. In addition, tools can shape students' performance and understanding of the task in terms of key disciplinary content and strategies and thus problematize this important content. Although making the task more difficult in the short term, by forcing learners to engage with this complexity, such scaffolded tools make this work more productive opportunities for learning. I present arguments for these mechanisms in terms of the obstacles learners face, and I present several brief examples to illustrate their use in design guidelines. Finally, I examine how the mechanisms of structuring and problematizing are sometimes complementary and sometimes in tension in design, discuss design tradeoffs in developing scaffolded investigation tools for learners, and consider the reliance of scaffolding on a classroom system of supports.},

Findings from the thematic analysis of one-on-one interviews with 12 students enrolled in the course are presented. Results demonstrate the susceptibility of first-year engineering students' self-efficacy beliefs to the influence of performance comparisons based on the speed with which students were able to perform various tasks, the degree of contribution they were able to achieve when working with others, how much material they had mastered, and their grades. Gender differences were also identified in the way in which men and women were influenced by these experiences. Descriptions of how students made performance comparisons, including the logical progression from a specific experience through the modification of confidence in success, are offered.},

  abstract = {This panel will look at how research theories developed in the context of mathematics education can be applied to computing science education as well as ways in which computing science theories may be used in mathematics education research. Computing science education is a young discipline still in search of its research framework [6]. A practical approach to formulating such a framework is to adapt useful approaches found in the research from other disciplines, both educational and related areas. At the same time, a young discipline may also offer innovative new approaches to the older discipline.The mathematics education discipline is relatively mature, with its roots extending from the close of the 19th century. For about the past 50 years, mathematics educators have been studying learning theories, teaching approaches, and other cognitive and social issues with respect to K-12 and higher education. We have found that many of these theories are useful for gaining insights into how students learn and understand computing science topics, as well as for improving how we teach these topics. For example, the constructivist perspective, which examines students' mental construction of knowledge [7], has had a tremendous impact on the teaching of mathematics. This paradigm, with its roots in Piaget's work, has started to exert a similar influence within computing science education, as evidenced by a recent article by Ben-Ari [4] and a subsequent special issue of Computer Science Education [10] that includes six articles about constructivism in various areas of computing.Another branch of mathematics education research theory focuses on student conceptions of specific mathematical concepts. For example, student understanding of the concept of function has been researched extensively in the mathematics education context [8]. This cumulative body of knowledge provides a basis for analyzing students' conceptions in many areas of a computing science program, including functional programming, object-oriented programming, and graph algorithms.The panelists will examine possibilities and pitfalls in some import and export attempts between mathematics education research and CS education research.},

  shorttitle = {Epistemology, Situated Cognition, and Mental Models},
  abstract = {Over the past two decades important educational implications have been drawn mainly from two movements of epistemology: Constructivism and situated cognition. Aside from a meta-theoretical use of constructivism, the concept 'situated cognition' refers to a conception of situational context bound to a historically and socially determined situational logic. Focusing on educational processes, situated cognition is considered to be a central construct for instruction, as is the closely related concept of the construction of mental models. There are various kinds of the construction and change of mental models in a situational context: self-guided inductive construction is one example; another is the processing of a conceptual model provided to the learner. An emerging question is how the preconception changes and if the effects of such a model transition are stable. An exploratory study will be sketched which investigates the significance of a conceptual model provided at the beginning of the learning process; it has been hypothesized, that such a conceptual model significantly impacts the stability (i.e. the successful reconstruction) of mental models built in the course of learning. Also considerable intraindividual differences and changes between two points of assessing the learners' causal explanations were found. Similarities of the individuals' reconstructions could be explained with regard to similarities of the structures of the learning situations and the related instructional intervention. In general, the results of this exploratory study support the assumption that mental models are constructed in dependence on the demands of learning situations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {Positive motivation and affect toward learning science are valued qualities among elementary school teachers. Such positive dispositions toward science may translate to increased teaching of science and greater general interest in the subject, ultimately benefiting the students in the teachers' classrooms. Specific motivational and affective qualities distinguished in the literature as particularly relevant to the teaching and learning of science include motivational goal orientation and self-concept of ability. In addition, a variable that seems to promote elementary teachers' positive attitude and interest in science teaching is experience with inquiry-based science instruction such as the learning cycle. The purpose of this study was to explore relationships between motivational goal orientation and self-concept of ability as preservice elementary teachers (N = 45) participate in a science learning cycle during methods course instruction. The results indicated significant positive relationships among self- concept of ability and learning goal orientation as the teachers engaged in the learning cycle. Implications of this study include an emphasis on inquiry-based teaching procedures in teacher education programs to help promote positive motivational and affective dispositions among new teachers.},

Most cognitive accomplishments rely in part on language, and language in use always has both representational and interactional functions. The article analyzes one classroom conversation, in order to illustrate how the interactional functions of speech can facilitate the cognitive accomplishments speakers make through that speech. By showing how closely cognition and interaction can interrelate, the article both supports theories of situated cognition and shows how cognition in at least some educational contexts cannot be extricated from enduring social structures and the construction of social identity.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the understanding of 18 first-year undergraduate students when simultaneously presented with two contrasting dynamical situations: the idealized (without air resistance) and real-world cases of balls being dropped or thrown. Previous work has shown that getting students to recognize flaws in their mental models helps them develop their understanding. Our students were better able to answer correctly the problems in idealized cases than the problems in real-world cases. For the real-world cases, the students understood the impact of air resistance on the object's size better than the impact of air resistance on objects of the same size but different mass. In follow-up interviews, the students reported that using the two different situations in the same test did indeed encourage them to think more carefully. By recognizing the need to include air resistance, they activated their appropriate mental ldquoresourcesrdquo to deal with the situations. We conclude that using contrasting situations (i.e., with and without an idealization) is a useful teaching tool. \dbend{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 41: 569-583, 2004},

  abstract = {The learning sciences community has made significant progress in understanding how people think and learn about complex systems. But less is known about how people make sense of the quantitative patterns and mathematical formalisms often used to study these systems. In this article, we make a case for attending to and supporting connections between the behavior of complex systems, and the quantitative and mathematical descriptions. We introduce a framework to examine how students connect the behavioral and quantitative aspects of complex systems and use it to analyze interviews with 11 high school students as they interacted with an agent-based simulation that produces simple exponential-like population growth. Although the students were comfortable describing many connections between the simulation's behavior and the quantitative patterns it generated, we found that they did not readily describe connections between individual behaviors and patterns of change. Case studies suggest that these missed connections led students who engaged in productive patterns of sense-making to nonetheless make errors interpreting quantitative patterns in the simulation. These difficulties could be resolved by drawing students' attention to the graph of quantitative change featured in the simulation environment and the underlying rules that generated it. We discuss implications for the design of learning environments, for the study of quantitative reasoning about complex systems, and for the role of mathematical reasoning in complex systems fluency.},

Drawing on sociocultural perspectives on learning and development, including Wenger (1998) and Saxe (1999), I describe findings from 2 studies of learning among African American students outside of school, in the cultural practices of dominoes and basketball. This research shows that indeed, as players come to learn these practices, they both shift in regard to the goals they seek to accomplish within the practice and change as they come to define themselves vis-a-vis the practice. The implications for understanding the relation between race, culture, and learning are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

However, little is known about the nature of secondary students' metacognitive strategy use, and how these strategies are applied when students work together on problems. The study described in this paper investigated the monitoring behaviour of a pair of senior secondary school students as they worked collaboratively on problems in applied mathematics. Analysis of verbal protocols from think aloud problem solving sessions showed that, although the students generally benefited from adopting complementary metacognitive roles, unhelpful social interactions sometimes impeded progress. The findings shed some light on the nature of individual and interactive metacognitive strategy use during collaborative activity.},

What a regulating principle means and how it works is illustrated in the far more modest content of (1) Boltzmann's law for the distribution of energy among molecules, (2) universality of exponents near thermodynamic critical points, (3) Wigner's ``semicircle law'' for the distribution of characteristic frequencies of a randomly coupled system, and (4) a new ``physicist's version'' of the problem of the traveling salesman. The regulating principles to be seen in these simple examples fall far short\textemdash{}in scope and simplicity\textemdash{}of the sought-for regulating principle.

To examine these cultural models of teaching and learning we use thematic analysis, clustering, scaling, and graphing techniques to analyze interview transcripts and classroom observation data among 41 undergraduate math and science instructors across three universities in the United States. We then focus on three individual cases of instructors to examine how their cultural models interact with other cultural models, existing forms of teaching practice, and features of instructional environments to shape their teaching practices. The article concludes by setting forth an agenda for future research and arguing that the ``cultures of teaching'' in these disciplines should not only be perceived as barriers but also opportunities for meaningful pedagogical innovation.},

  abstract = {This article uses a critical evaluation of research on student misconceptions in science and mathematics to articulate a constructivist view of learning in which student conceptions play productive roles in the acquisition of expertise. We acknowledge and build on the empirical results of misconceptions research but question accompanying views of the character, origins, and growth of students' conceptions. Students have often been viewed as holding flawed ideas that are strongly held, that interfere with learning, and that instruction must confront and replace. We argue that this view overemphasizes the discontinuity between students and expert scientists and mathematicians, making the acquisition of expertise difficult to conceptualize. It also conflicts with the basic premise of constructivism: that students build more advanced knowledge from prior understandings. Using case analyses, we dispute some commonly cited dimensions of discontinuity and identify important continuities that were previously ignored or underemphasized. We highlight elements of knowledge that serve both novices and experts, albeit in different contexts and under different conditions. We provide an initial sketch of a constructivist theory of learning that interprets students' prior conceptions as resources for cognitive growth within a complex systems view of knowledge. This theoretical perspective aims to characterize the interrelationships among diverse knowledge elements rather than identify particular flawed conceptions; it emphasizes knowledge refinement and reorganization, rather than replacement, as primary metaphors for learning; and it provides a framework for understanding misconceptions as both flawed and productive.},

Although some of the implications are deemed desirable and others are regarded as harmful, the article neither speaks against a particular metaphor nor tries to make a case for the other. Rather, these interpretations and applications of the metaphors undergo critical evaluation. In the end, the question of theoretical unification of the research on learning is addressed, wherein the purpose is to show how too great a devotion to one particular metaphor can lead to theoretical distortions and to undesirable practices.},

There is still a significant lack of clarity surrounding methodological and epistemological features of this body of work. In fact, there is a broad variety of theory being developed in this mode of research. In contrast to recent efforts to seek a singular definition for design experimentation, I argue that methodological and epistemological issues are significantly more tractable if considered from the perspective of manifold families of theoretically framed design-based research. After characterizing a range of such families, I suggest that, as we deliberate on the nature of design-based research, greater attention should be given to the pluralistic nature of learning theory, to the relation between theory and method, and to working across theoretical and methodological boundaries through the use of mixed methods. Finally, I suggest that design-based research-with its focus on promoting, sustaining, and understanding innovation in the world-should be considered a form of scholarly inquiry that sits alongside the panoply of canonical forms ranging from the experimental, historical, philosophical, sociological, legal, and interpretive.},

  copyright = {Copyright ProQuest, UMI Dissertations Publishing 2008},
  shorttitle = {Improvising Onstage and Off},
  abstract = {This dissertation is an exploration of "style" or the use of language to project a social persona or identity (Coupland 2004; 2007; Eckert 2000; Schilling-Estes 1998, 2002, 2004), focusing on a community of performers of improvisational theater in Washington DC, with whom I conducted ethnographic research from January 2005 through July 2007. Working from within a "speaker design" approach to style, I suggest increased use of anthropological approaches to style (including use of ethnography and the study of performative contexts of language use) as well as discourse analytic approaches. Specifically, I illustrate how discourse aspects of language function as a resources that speakers use agentively and creatively in interaction.
There has been a considerable push in recent years to integrate anthropological and discourse analytic approaches in variationist stylistic inquiry to better understand the social meanings of style. This research continues and expands this development, suggesting that ethnographic and discourse analytic approaches enrich variationist analyses in two general ways. First, the approaches to data collection and analysis entailed in the anthropological and discourse analytic paradigms motivate a critical reexamination of some of the theoretical and methodological assumptions of traditional variationist studies of style. Secondly, discourse analysis provides the researcher with discourse features as units for analysis, discourse analytic frameworks for uncovering and interpreting the connections among language and social meaning, and a perspective on how identity is negotiated in interaction as achieved through discourse analysis itself.
While studies of linguistic style continue to draw mainly from linguistic structure at the level of phonology, morphology, and syntax, I consider relatively broader features of language including the choice to perform (or the choice to avoid performing) a socially recognizable dialect, the use of the voices of others through quotation (constructed dialogue) to reflect information about self, and the collaborative negotiation of frame shifts to playfully enact frame shifts and play spontaneous intertextual games. I suggest that such units drawn from higher levels of linguistic structure provide a more complete picture of the linguistic resources speakers have available to them in constructing, negotiating, and performing identity.
Additionally, I suggest that discourse frameworks (including framing, footing, stance, alignment, positioning, and intertextuality) contribute greatly to our understanding of linguistic style by linking up micro-level linguistic processes to more macro-level processes including the negotiation of social meaning. Framing, for example, helps us to understand how speaker awareness of frame, or "what is going on in interaction" (Goffman 1974) determines what language can be used (e.g. dialect performance) and what social significance such language carries in different interactional contexts. Finally, I argue that discourse analysis itself allows for the active tracking of the negotiation of meaning in interaction, including metacommentary about group members' use(s) of language. I argue that the unique ways in which such features are deployed in interaction contribute to this group's style, which has implications for identity.
Ultimately, I suggest that a combined variationist, ethnographic, and discourse approach to style enables the analyst to better understand the range of stylistic resources that speakers have available to them to construct, negotiate, and perform identity.},

  abstract = {Expert mathematicians are contrasted with undergraduate students through a two-part analysis of the potential and actual use of visual representations in problem solving. In the first part, a classification task is used to indicate the extent to which visual representations are perceived as having potential utility for advanced mathematical problem solving. The analysis reveals that both experts and novices perceive visual representation use as a viable strategy. However, the two groups judge visual representations likely to be useful with different sets of problems. Novices generally indicate that visual representations would likely be useful mostly for geometry problems, whereas the experts indicate potential application to a wider variety of problems. In the second part, written solutions to problems and verbal protocols of problem-solving episodes are analyzed to determine the frequency, nature, and function of the visual representations actually used during problem solving. Experts construct visual representations more frequently than do novices and use them as dynamic objects to explore the problem space qualitatively, to develop a better understanding of the problem situation, and to guide their solution planning and enactment of problem-solving activity. In contrast, novices typically make little use of visual representations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

In the regular case, sign exchanges are considered to rest on a kind of shared obviousness. The knowledge imbalance between actors of the didactical situation renders this shared obviousness minimal, and therefore requires distinguishing different kinds of sign exchange processes. From the notion of semiosis, we define the processes of tacitation and implicitation. We present a field study from these theoretical concepts and discuss some implications for future research.},

Unfortunately, many studies have shown this promise is not always achieved. The DeFT (Design, Functions, Tasks) framework for learning with multiple representations integrates research on learning, the cognitive science of representation and constructivist theories of education. It proposes that the effectiveness of multiple representations can best be understood by considering three fundamental aspects of learning: the design parameters that are unique to learning with multiple representations; the functions that multiple representations serve in supporting learning and the cognitive tasks that must be undertaken by a learner interacting with multiple representations. The utility of this framework is proposed to be in identifying a broad range of factors that influence learning, reconciling inconsistent experimental findings, revealing under-explored areas of multi-representational research and pointing forward to potential design heuristics for learning with multiple representations.$<$/p$>$},

  abstract = {Understanding the nature of errors in a simple, rule-based task--programming a VCR--required analyzing the interactions among human cognition, the artifact, and the task. This analysis was guided by least-effort principles and yielded a control structure that combined a rule hierarchy task-to-device with display-based difference-reduction. A model based on this analysis was used to trace action protocols collected from participants as they programmed a simulated VCR. Trials that ended without success (the show was not correctly programmed) were interrogated to yield insights regarding problems in acquiring the control structure. For successful trials (the show was correctly programmed), steps that the model would make were categorized as matches to the model; steps that the model would not make were violations of the model. The model was able to trace the vast majority of correct keystrokes and yielded a business-as-usual account of the detection and correction of errors. Violations of the model fell into one of two fundamental categories. The model provided insights into certain subcategories of errors; whereas, regularities within other subcategories of error suggested limitations to the model. Although errors were rare when compared to the total number of correct actions, they were important. Errors were made on 4\% of the keypresses that, if not detected, would have prevented two-thirds of the shows from being successfully recorded. A misprogrammed show is a minor annoyance to the user. However, devices with the approximate complexity of a VCR are ubiquitous and have found their way into emergency rooms, airplane cockpits, power plants, and so on. Errors of ignorance may be reduced by training; however, errors in the routine performance of skilled users can only be reduced by design.},

The study supported utilization of factors external to the students' college experience identified in the retention literature based on Bean's (1980) Student Attrition Model.

In this article, we present five potentially complementary explanations for how expansive framing may promote transfer and outline a research agenda for further investigating them. Specifically, we propose that expansive framing may: (a) foster an expectation that students will continue to use what they learn later, which may affect the learning process in ways that can promote transfer; (b) create links between learning and transfer contexts so that prior learning is viewed as relevant during potential transfer contexts; (c) encourage learners to draw on their prior knowledge during learning, which may involve them transferring in additional examples and making generalizations; (d) make learners accountable for intelligently reporting on the specific content they have authored; and (e) promote authorship as a general practice in which students learn that their role is to generate their own solutions to new problems and adapt their existing knowledge in transfer contexts.},

We used the "black box"-based instructional method to teach basic concepts of computation to novice high-school students. Later we conducted research aimed at assessing the effectiveness of this method on novice students' perceptions of basic concepts in computation. Research results indicated that students who learned according to the "black box"-based approach gained a better understanding of the basic computational model, compared to students who learned according to the traditional "zipper" approach.},

At an interactive exhibit, visitors can act on the exhibit and the exhibit reacts. While there is much theoretical and empirical support for the idea that interactive features promote science learning, we believe that serious design problems can arise if an uncritical ``more is better'' approach is taken to interactivity. This article describes five common pitfalls of designing exhibits with high levels of interactivity or multiple interactive features: 1) multiple options with equal salience, 2) features allowing multiple users to interfere with one another, 3) options that encourage users to disrupt the phenomenon being displayed, 4) features that make the critical phenomenon difficult to find, and 5) secondary features that obscure the primary feature. Examples of each of the five problems are presented, and possible design solutions are offered.},

Our data set compares results from over 800 students on identical tests from both robotics and non-robotics based laboratory sessions. We also examine the effectiveness of robots in encouraging students to select computer science or computer engineering as a field of study.Our results are negative: test scores were lower in the robotics sections than in the non-robotics ones, nor did the use of robots have any measurable effect on students choice of discipline. We believe the most significant factor that accounts for this is the lack of a simulator for our robotics programming system. Students in robotics sections must run and debug their programs on robots during assigned lab times, and are therefore deprived of both reflective time and the rapid compile-run-debug cycle outside of class that is an important part of the learning process. We discuss this and other issues, and suggest directions for future work.},

  abstract = {This paper empirically argues for a closer examination of what we wish to retain when we speak of "retention" in engineering [1]. We present and interpret data from clinical interviews and classroom video of "Michael," a student who feels marginalized by an engineering program that undervalues him because of his stance toward knowledge [2],[3]. Michael is a sophomore Electrical Engineering and Mathematics major in a Basic Circuits course. In his own words, he's a "fringe" student because of his robust tendency to try making sense of the concepts being taught rather than memorizing formulae. He also feels alienated because he views learning in terms of argument and intuition, not algorithm and rote acceptance. Furthermore, for Michael the practice of sense-making defines him; it's an integral aspect of his identity [4]. Thus, Michael's self-reported sense of alienation resonates strongly with existing identity-based accounts of students leaving the field [5],[6]. We contend the field of engineering suffers if individuals like Michael don't pursue it. Through this case study of Michael, we urge the retention discussion to consider not just the demographic categories of people we hope to keep, but also the approaches to knowledge, learning, and problem-solving we aim to support.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Despite decades of effort focused on improvement of engineering education, many recent advances have not resulted in systemic change. Diffusion of innovations theory is used to better understand this phenomenon. PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS) Research questions include: How widespread is awareness and adoption of established engineering education innovations? Are there differences by discipline or institutional type? How do engineering department chairs find out about engineering education innovations? What factors do engineering department chairs cite as important in adoption decisions? DESIGN/METHOD U.S. engineering department chairs were surveyed regarding their awareness and department use of seven engineering education innovations. One hundred ninety-seven usable responses are presented primarily as categorical data with Chi square tests where relevant. RESULTS Overall, the awareness rate was 82 percent, while the adoption rate was 47 percent. Eighty-two percent of engineering departments employ student-active pedagogies (the highest). Mechanical and civil engineering had the highest rates, in part due to many design-related innovations in the survey. Few differences by institution type were evident. In the past, word of mouth and presentations were far more effective than publications in alerting department chairs to the innovations. Department chairs cited financial resources, faculty time and attitudes, and student satisfaction and learning as major considerations in adoption decisions. CONCLUSIONS The importance of disciplinary networks was evident during survey administration and in the results. Specific recommendations are offered to employ these networks and the engineering professional societies for future engineering education improvement efforts.},

Designing activities that are effective, however, requires an additional framework for identifying a discipline's generative resources-that is, those learning targets that enable students to make disciplinary sense and progress in subsequent situations. This study represents an empirical exploration of the generative resources supported by alternative descriptions of experimentation, 1 focusing on its logical aspects and another on its measurement aspects. Each description of experimentation was portrayed in 1 of 2 concurrent 6th-grade units. In a broad capture of learning outcomes, assessment data suggest particular dimensions of learning-characterized here as game, pieces, and players-account for students' subsequent generative behavior. Striking differences in disciplinary facility were apparent from what students learned from these contrasting units, highlighting the instructional importance of supporting generative resources for valued disciplinary activity. This exploration of generative resources draws on recent efforts to reconceptualize transfer and adds to accumulating examples of design-based research as an effective methodology for supporting sound instruction and innovation.},

A diagnostic questionnaire was administered to a sample of 145 high school students and 21 physics teachers. The questionnaire included mainly qualitative questions which were designed to examine students' understanding of the functional relationships between the variables in an electric circuit. The main findings obtained from the analysis of the responses are current is the primary concept used by students, whereas potential difference is regarded as a c o n s e q u e n c e of current flow, and not as its c a u s e. Consequently students often use V=I R incorrectly. A battery is regarded as a source of constant current. The concepts of emf and internal resistance are not well understood. Students have difficulties in analyzing the effect which a change in one component has on the rest of the circuit. This is probably due to the more general difficulty students have in dealing with a simultaneous change of several variables.},

Undiscovered natural gas is three times more abundant than oil in the Arctic and is largely concentrated in Russia. Oil resources, although important to the interests of Arctic countries, are probably not sufficient to substantially shift the current geographic pattern of world oil production.},

The structure of this article parallels the sequence of her learning experiences. The findings generate an enhanced view of transcription and transcriber as methodological components, provide a clearer vision for researcher positioning on the intersecting landscapes of transcription and qualitative methodology, and illuminate some implications for the training of qualitative researchers.},

  abstract = {One of the subjects that undergraduate students learning Object Oriented (OO) design find hard to apply is the construction of class hierarchies in general, and the use of interface classes in particular. The design process requires decomposition and reconstruction of problems in order to model software classes. The common attributes and behaviors are usually modeled using class inheritance except when the common behaviors do not belong to the same class hierarchy; in such case, an interface class is preferred. In order to be able to properly design, the designer has to demonstrate the abstraction abilities on various levels. In this study, we aimed at examining the students' demonstration of abstraction levels during design of class hierarchy in general, and whether or not they use interface classes in particular. The results of the study reveal that a majority of students were able to build a reasonable class hierarchy; however, many of them did not use interface classes as a tool for expressing common behaviors. Nevertheless, all of them could identify and choose the best solution for a particular problem among four different solutions, which included the use of interface class. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

  abstract = {High-level software design is characterized by incompletely specified requirements, no predetermined solution path, and by the integration of multiple domains of knowledge at various levels of abstraction. The application of data-driven knowledge rules characterizes expertise. A verbal protocol study describes these domains of knowledge and how experts exploit their rich knowledge during design. It documents how designers heavily rely on problem domain scenario simulations throughout solution development. These simulations trigger the inferences of new requirements and complete the requirement specification. Designers recognize partial solutions at various levels of abstraction in the design decomposition through the application of data-driven rules. Designers also rely heavily on simulations of their design solutions. but these are shallow, that is, limited to one level of abstraction in the solution. The findings also illustrate how designers capitalize on design methods, notations, and specialized software design schemas. Finally, the study describes how designers exploit powerful heuristics and personalized evaluation criteria to constrain the design process and select a satisfactory solution. Studies, such as this one, help map the road to understanding expertise in complex tasks.},

Research in cognitive semantics claims that the human conceptual capacity rests on a foundation of image schemas: topological patterns of spatial relations and simple dynamics abstracted from sensorimotor experience. A cognitive ethnography of elementary mathematics lessons in clock-reading reveals different image schemas used to read the hour for landmark times (three o'clock), relative times (a quarter past three), and absolute times (three fifteen). When considered together with the sequence of learning, the image schema analysis predicts the most common error observed in children's time-telling while also revealing the source of latent errors that lead to sudden breakdowns. Comparison of the image-schematic structure of different levels of sophistication in reading ``quarter past'' times illustrates how enriched image-schematic structure interrelates different aspects of time-telling, supporting flexible performance in novel situations. Relating visible actions to these aspects of ongoing conceptualization will help experts provide a more complete account of embodied mathematical cognition, teaching, and learning.},

However, when confronted with more complicated exercises many pupils experience difficulties in solving them. A computer program about the subject of forces was developed containing hints for the various different episodes of problem-solving. A study was undertaken with a group taking part in the experiment ( n = 11) who used both their textbook and the computer program, and a control group ( n = 25) who used their textbook only. There was evidence to show that the pupils from the group taking part in the experiment did achieve higher results in solving problems. Exploration and planning were improved but evaluation was not. It appeared that pupils involved in the experiment made better use of their declarative knowledge in solving problems than pupils from the control group.

"Somewhere in Des Moines or San Antonio there is a young gay person who all the sudden realizes that he or she is gay; knows that if their parents find out they will be tossed out of the house, their classmates will taunt the child, and the Anita Bryant's and John Briggs' are doing their part on TV. And that child has several options: staying in the closet, and suicide. And then one day that child might open the paper that says "Homosexual elected in San Francisco" and there are two new options: the option is to go to California, or stay in San Antonio and fight. Two days after I was elected I got a phone call and the voice was quite young. It was from Altoona, Pennsylvania. And the person said "Thanks". And you've got to elect gay people, so that thousand upon thousands like that child know that there is hope for a better world; there is hope for a better tomorrow. Without hope, not only gays, but those who are blacks, the Asians, the disabled, the seniors, the us's: without hope the us's give up. I know that you can't live on hope alone, but without it, life is not worth living. And you, and you, and you, and you have got to give them hope."

  abstract = {Advances in graphical technology have now made it possible for us to interact with information in innovative ways, most notably by exploring multimedia environments and by manipulating three-dimensional virtual worlds. Many benefits have been claimed for this new kind of interactivity, a general assumption being that learning and cognitive processing are facilitated. We point out, however, that little is known about the cognitive value ofanygraphical representations, be they good old-fashioned (e.g. diagrams) or more advanced (e.g. animations, multimedia, virtual reality). In our paper, we critique the disparate literature on graphical representations, focusing on four representative studies. Our analysis reveals a fragmented and poorly understood account of how graphical representations work, exposing a number of assumptions and fallacies. As an alternative we propose a new agenda for graphical representation research. This builds on the nascent theoretical approach within cognitive science that analyses the role played by external representations in relation to internal mental ones. We outline some of the central properties of this relationship that are necessary for the processing of graphical representations. Finally, we consider how this analysis can inform the selection and design of both traditional and advanced forms of graphical technology.},

  abstract = {The study we describe here, an ethnographic investigation of the cognitive work of three programming teams, led us to emphasize an aspect of activity that is relatively unexplored: the developing perspective of intellectual workers on their contexts of action. 1 We followed teams of students in a department of computer science as they were being taught
"software engineering." Despite their subordinate position as students, we found that the institution was not totally successful in dictating their work; we could not assume a similarity of work activity across teams. Instead, the teams' perspectives on their projects were collectively developed over the course of the project, and they diverged. Consequently, the teams differed in their construal of the objects of their intellectual work, the significance and time they devoted to the components of their work, and the ways in which they carried out the project. In this chapter we recount these differences and relate them ultimately to ongoing tensions and contradictions within and outside the university. "Perspective," we argue, usefully extends the applicability of theories of situated cognition, especially activity theory, to the type of diversity we encountered.2},

The question addressed in this study is, To what extent do students appropriate scientific ways of knowing and reasoning as a result of their participation in collaborative scientific inquiry? The focus of our analysis was on changes in students' conceptual knowledge and use of hypotheses, experiments, and explanations to organize their reasoning in the context of two think aloud problems. In September the students' reasoning was nonanalytic and bound to personal experience. They responded as if they were being asked to answer questions in a reading comprehension task. In contrast, by June they reasoned in terms of a larger explanatory system, used hypotheses to organize and give direction to their reasoning, and demonstrated an awareness of the function of experimentation in producing evidence to evaluate hypotheses.},

Here, we examine the use of one such display, a multi-representational molecular mechanics animation, by organic chemistry undergraduates in a problem-solving interview. Using both protocol analysis and eye fixation data, our analysis indicates that students rely mainly on two visual\textendash{}spatial representations in the display and do not make use of two accompanying mathematical representations. Moreover, we explore how eye fixation data complement verbal protocols by providing information about how students allocate their attention to different locations of a multi-representational display with and without concurrent verbal utterances. Our analysis indicates that verbal protocols and eye movement data are highly correlated, suggesting that eye fixations and verbalizations reflect similar cognitive processes in such studies.},

  abstract = {There is a long, rich history of arguments for the importance of involving students in a process of inquiry. For many instructors, however, promoting student inquiry is a difficult agenda to pursue for two reasons. First, there is often tension for instructors between concerns for this agenda and more traditional concerns for the correctness and completeness of students' understanding. Second, it is not easy to recognize when productive student inquiry is taking place. For a teacher in class, what is valuable about the students' participation at any given moment may-not be as obvious as what is flawed and ambiguous in their arguments. For this article, I analyze a short excerpt from a high school physics class discussion to consider the value of the students' work as inquiry and to illustrate a teacher's negotiation of the tension between inquiry and traditional content-oriented concerns. In this way, I try to discover the beginnings of science in what the students say and do, rather than to apply criteria from a particular model of scientific reasoning. This exploration for students' knowledge and abilities is offered both as an approach to research on student inquiry and as a mode of instructional practice to support that inquiry.},

  abstract = {It is well known that many students encounter difficulties when solving problems in mathematics. Research indicates that some of these difficulties may stem from intuitive interference with formal/logical reasoning. Our research aims at deepening the understanding of these difficulties and their underlying reasoning mechanisms to help students overcome them. For this purpose we carried out behavioral, brain imaging and intervention studies focusing on a previously demonstrated obstacle in mathematics education. The literature reports that many students believe that shapes with a larger area must have a larger perimeter. We measured the accuracy of responses, reaction time, and neural correlates (by fMRI) while participants compared the perimeters of geometrical shapes in two conditions: (1) congruent, in which correct response was in line with intuitive reasoning ( larger area \textendash{} larger perimeter ) and (2) incongruent, in which the correct answer was counterintuitive. In the incongruent condition, accuracy dropped and reaction time for correct responses was longer than in the congruent condition. The congruent condition activated bilateral parietal brain areas, known to be involved in the comparison of quantities, while correctly answering the incongruent condition activated bilateral prefrontal areas known for their executive control over other brain regions. The intervention, during which students' attention was drawn to the relevant variable, increased accuracy in the incongruent condition, while reaction times increased in both congruent and incongruent conditions. The findings of the three studies point to the importance of control mechanisms in overcoming intuitive interference in mathematics. Overall, it appears that adding a cognitive neuroscience perspective to mathematics education research can contribute to a better understanding of students' difficulties and reasoning processes. Such information is important for educational research and practice.},

  abstract = {This article aims to contribute to the literature on conceptual change by engaging in direct theoretical and empirical comparison of contrasting views. We take up the question of whether na{\"\i}ve physical ideas are coherent or fragmented, building specifically on recent work supporting claims of coherence with respect to the concept of force by Ioannides and Vosniadou [Ioannides, C., \& Vosniadou, C. (2002). The changing meanings of force. Cognitive Science Quarterly 2, 5\textendash{}61]. We first engage in a theoretical inquiry on the nature of coherence and fragmentation, concluding that these terms are not well-defined, and proposing a set of issues that may be better specified. The issues have to do with contextuality, which concerns the range of contexts in which a concept (meaning, model, theory) applies, and relational structure, which is how elements of a concept (meaning, model, or theory) relate to one another. We further propose an enhanced theoretical and empirical accountability for what and how much one needs to say in order to have specified a concept. Vague specification of the meaning of a concept can lead to many kinds of difficulties.Empirically, we conducted two studies. A study patterned closely on Ioannides and Vosniadou's work (which we call a quasi-replication) failed to confirm their operationalizations of ``coherent.'' An extension study, based on a more encompassing specification of the concept of force, showed three kinds of results: (1) Subjects attend to more features than mentioned by Ioannides and Vosniadou, and they changed answers systematically based on these features; (2)We found substantial differences in the way subjects thought about the new contexts we asked about, which undermined claims for homogeneity within even the category of subjects (having one particular meaning associated with ``force'') that best survived our quasi-replication; (3) We found much reasoning of subjects about forces that cannot be accounted for by the meanings specified by Ioannides and Vosniadou. All in all, we argue that, with a greater attention to contextuality and with an appropriately broad specification of the meaning of a concept like force, Ioannides and Vosniadou's claims to have demonstrated coherence seem strongly undermined. Students' ideas are not random and chaotic; but neither are they simply described and strongly systematic.},

A primary purpose of a visualization tool is to provide domain-relevant insight into the data. Ideally, any user wants maximum information in the least possible time. In this paper we identify several distinct characteristics of insight that enable us to recognize and quantify it. Based on this, we empirically evaluate five popular microarray visualization tools.

Two pictures of the instruction and its results emerged from the study. On the one hand, almost everything that took place in the classroom went as intended\textemdash{}both in terms of the curriculum and in terms of the quality of the instruction. The class was well managed and well taught, and the students did well on standard performance measures. Seen from this perspective, the class was quite successful. Yet from another perspective, the class was an important and illustrative failure. There were significant ways in which, from the mathematician's point of view, having taken the course may have done the students as much harm as good. Despite gaining proficiency at certain kinds of procedures, the students gained at best a fragmented sense of the subject matter and understood few if any of the connections that tie together the procedures that they had studied. More importantly, the students developed perspectives regarding the nature of mathematics that were not only inaccurate, but were likely to impede their acquisition and use of other mathematical knowledge. The implications of these findings for reseach on teaching and learning are discussed.},

Focusing on how youth engaged a summer unit on understanding and modeling the relationship between energy use and the health of the urban environment, we use ethnographic data to discuss how the youth asserted themselves as community science experts in ways that took up and broke down the contradictory roles of being a producer and a critic of science/education. Our findings suggest that youth actively appropriate project activities and tools in order to challenge the types of roles and student voice traditionally available to students in the classroom.},

The last hypotheses predicts that students who experience the classroom in a positive way will have a more positive career outlook.

  abstract = {The way in which novice programmers learn to write code is of considerable interest to computing education researchers. One research approach to understanding how beginners acquire their programming abilities has been to look at student performance in exams. Lopez et al. (2008) analyzed student responses to an end-of-first-semester exam. They found two types of questions accounted for 46\% of the variance on the code writing portion of the same exam. One of those types of question required students to trace iterative code, while the other type required students to explain what a piece of code did. In this paper, we investigate whether the results by Lopez et al. may be generally indicative of something about novice programmers, or whether their results are just an artifact of their particular exam. We studied student responses to our own exam and our results are broadly consistent with Lopez et al. However, we did find that some aspects of their model are sensitive to the particular exam questions used. Specifically, we found that student performance on explaining code was hard to characterize, and the strength of the relationship between explaining and code writing is particularly sensitive to the specific questions asked. Additionally, we found Lopez et al.'s use of a Rasch model to be unnecessary, which will make it far easier for others to conduct similar research.},

In this article, we compare these different frameworks, focusing on their instructional implications by using them to analyze a third-grade teacher's epistemologically motivated intervention and its effect on her students.

We contest this work in two ways: (1) it reflects a misunderstanding of expert knowledge, and (2) reasoning by experts and novices often traverses ontological categories in both professional and everyday contexts. We cite examples from research articles as well as classroom discussions to illustrate that experts as well as novices hop across ontological boundaries to make sense of physical phenomenon. This suggests a dynamic context-dependent model of a person's ontological view. To promote one ontological description in physics instruction, as suggested by Slotta and Chi, could suppress an essential skill for the development of expertise.},

  abstract = {We argue that learning about the nature and utility of scientific models and engaging in the process of creating and testing models should be a central focus of science education. To realize this vision, we created and evaluated the Model-Enhanced ThinkerTools (METT) Curriculum, which is an inquiry-oriented physics curriculum for middle school students in which they learn about the nature of scientific models and engage in the process of modeling. Key components of our approach include enabling students to create computer models that express their own theories of force and motion, evaluate their models using criteria such as accuracy and plausibility, and engage in discussions about models and the process of modeling. Curricular trials in four science classes of an urban middle school indicate that this approach can facilitate a significant improvement in students' understanding of modeling. Further analyses revealed that the approach was particularly successful in clarifying and broadening students' understanding of the nature and purpose of models. The METT Curriculum also led to significant improvements in inquiry skills and physics knowledge. Comparisons of METT students' performance with that of prior ThinkerTools students suggest that the acquisition of metamodeling knowledge contributed to these gains. In particular, METT students wrote significantly better conclusions on the inquiry test and performed better on some of the far-transfer problems on the physics test. Finally, correlational results, including significant correlations of pretest modeling and inquiry scores with posttest physics scores, suggests that developing knowledge of modeling and inquiry transfers to the learning of science content within such a curriculum. Taken together, the findings suggest that an emphasis on model-based inquiry, accompanied by the development of metamodeling knowledge, can facilitate learning science content while also developing students' understanding of the scientific enterprise.

Our comparative analysis highlights interactional supports for identifying, elaborating, and stabilizing relatively small-scale innovations in joint work that contribute to development at multiple timescales. These supports include comparisons over accounts of practice that borrow and extend method or technique, negotiating adequate representations of practice, use and uptake of epistemic stance toward what can be known about shared work, and surrounding organizational structures that provide for (or inhibit) the circulation of new concepts across workgroups.},

Emotions are perceived as being constituted by the dynamic interplay of cognitive, physiological, and motivational processes in a specific context. Understanding the role of emotions in the mathematics classroom then implies understanding the nature of these situated processes and the way they relate to students' problem-solving behaviour. We will present data from a multiple-case study of 16 students out of 4 different junior high classes that aimed to investigate students' emotional processes when solving a mathematical problem in their classrooms. After identifying the different emotions and analyzing their relations to motivational and cognitive processes, the relation with students' mathematics-related beliefs will be examined. We will specifically use Frank's case to illustrate how the use of a thoughtful combination of a variety of different research instruments enabled us to gather insightful data on the role of emotions in mathematical problem solving.},

Five categories were identified: beliefs about mathematics, development of beliefs, effects of beliefs on behavior, domain differences, and changing beliefs. Studies examining beliefs about mathematics revealed consistent patterns of nonavailing beliefs at all educational levels. Mathematics instructional environments were inferred to influence the development of beliefs about mathematics. All studies revealed significant relationships between beliefs and cognition, motivation, and academic achievement. Descriptive studies found relationships between beliefs and learning behaviors. Studies examining domain differences found significant variations in beliefs across disciplines. Studies focusing on changing beliefs were successful, which was attributed to appropriate changes in instructional style. The article concludes with suggestions for future research.},

Consistent with this philosophy is the focus on the event-driven model of computation [7]. While one can utilize these approaches with any thread and/or event supporting object-oriented language (e.g. Java) in a desktop programming environment, they become particularly worthwhile when used in conjunction with physical robots. This paper argues the case for the benefits of this approach and provides sample exercises that illustrate the use of this pedagogy using Lego Mindstorms RCX bricks programmed in Java for use in introductory programming.},

Participants in this study (a Black woman, a Latina, and an American Indian woman) survived inadequate high schools and discouraging college science departments to win formal recognition (fellowships, publications). Using multiracial feminist theory, including intersectionality, and practice theory, we conceptualize authoring of identity as an ongoing process. Qualitative methods were designed around Black feminist precepts of caring and personal accountability, the use of concrete experience and of dialogue (Collins, 2000a). Participants' opportunities to author legitimate science identities were constrained by their location in the matrix of oppression. They reported conflicts between their identities as women of color and as credible science students, and having racist, sexist identities ascribed to them. All became more adept at fending off negative ascription and all found settings with less identity conflict; their ability to read a situation and quickly adjust, la facultad (Anzald{\'u}a, 1999) helped them survive. But the fact that they have needed to do this is unjust. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Inc. J Res Sci Teach 48: 339\textendash{}366, 2011},

Results from a quasi-experimental study of 86 students (44 using NumberNet, 42 using a paper-based comparison activity) indicated that all students increased in fluency after completing these activities, while students who used NumberNet~also increased in flexibility. Video analysis of the NumberNet groups indicate that the opportunity to collaborate, and learn from other groups' expressions, may have supported this increase in flexibility. The final phase of the task suggests future possibilities for engaging students in mathematical discourse to further support the development of mathematical adaptive expertise.},

In this article, we provide evidence of the reliability (i.e., internal consistency) and validity of the instrument. The evidence consists of correlations of survey scores with a mandated performance assessment in Grade 6 mathematics, congruence with classroom observations of a small sample of teachers, and demonstrations that teachers who are similar in their claims about using a standards-based text series differ in how they use the text in ways predicted by the survey.},

Central findings of the study are that networked activities provided the opportunity for students and the teacher to: (a) act on multiple representations, (b) create collectively a linked set of mathematical objects that they could examine and discuss together, and (c) exercise agency in the production of mathematical discourse and practice. These opportunities fostered the development of powerful mathematical discourse. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  doi = {10.1145/2016911.2016934},
  abstract = {Many novice programmers view programming tools as all-knowing, infallible authorities about what is right and wrong about code. This misconception is particularly detrimental to beginners, who may view the cold, terse, and often judgmental errors from compilers as a sign of personal failure. It is possible, however, that attributing this failure to the computer, rather than the learner, may improve learners' motivation to program. To test this hypothesis, we present Gidget, a game where the eponymous robot protagonist is cast as a fallible character that blames itself for not being able to correctly write code to complete its missions. Players learn programming by working with Gidget to debug its problematic code. In a two-condition controlled experiment, we manipulated Gidget's level of personification in: communication style, sound effects, and image. We tested our game with 116 self-described novice programmers recruited on Amazon's Mechanical Turk and found that, when given the option to quit at any time, those in the experimental condition (with a personable Gidget) completed significantly more levels in a similar amount of time. Participants in the control and experimental groups played the game for an average time of 39.4 minutes (SD=34.3) and 50.1 minutes (SD=42.6) respectively. These finding suggest that how programming tool feedback is portrayed to learners can have a significant impact on motivation to program and learning success.},

In this article, the episodic learner model ELM is introduced as a hybrid system that analyses novices' solutions to programming tasks based on both rulebased and case-based reasoning. ELM behaves like to a human tutor. Initially, ELM is able to analyze problem solutions based only on its domain knowledge. With increasing knowledge about a particular learner captured in a dynamic episodic case base, it adapts to the learner's individual problem-solving behavior. Two simulation studies were performed to validate the system. The first study shows that the system can learn which rules are applied successfully to diagnose code produced by programmers and that using this information reduces the computational effort of diagnoses. Using information from the episodic learner model additionally speeds up the diagnostic process. The second study shows that ELM is able to predict individual solutions. Finally, correspondences and differences to related systems are discussed.},

  title = {Dynamics of Disciplinary Understandings and Practices of Attending to Student Thinking in Elementary Teacher Education},
  abstract = {This paper presents case studies of three elementary teacher candidates in a one-year master's certification program, focusing on their participation in science and mathematics methods courses. Through one primary case and two contrasting cases, we examine the interplay among a teacher candidate's orientation to each discipline (math and science), orientation towards discipline-specific teaching, and emerging practices of attending to student thinking in disciplinary domains. This study is of interest because it reveals significant differences between learning to teach science and math, suggesting that practices of attending have disciplinary grounding and therefore do not necessarily transfer across disciplinary contexts. We argue that better understanding these dynamics becomes important for teacher education, particularly for elementary teachers, who are responsible for teaching across disciplines.},

Although researchers studying commonsense science have employed a variety of methods, 1-on-1 clinical interviews have played a unique role. The data that result from these interviews take the form of video recordings, which in turn are often compiled into written transcripts and coded by human analysts. In this article, I explore the application of computational techniques to the analysis of this familiar type of data. I describe the success I have had using extremely simple methods from computational linguistics\textemdash{}methods that are based on rudimentary vector space models and simple clustering algorithms. These automated analyses are employed in an exploratory mode as a way to discover student conceptions in the data. The aims of this article are primarily methodological in nature: I attempt to show that it is possible to use techniques from computational linguistics to analyze data from commonsense science interviews in a manner that may provide convergent support for the work of human analysts. As a test bed, I draw on transcripts of a corpus of interviews in which 54 middle school students were asked to explain the seasons.},

My identity is that of a mathematics educator with a theoretical commitment to design research. To clarify, for almost seven years I collaborated with Paul Cobb, Koeno Gravemeijer and others in the execution of classroom design experiments in which I acted as the teacher. In these settings, I was working from the inside out to first, in action , make sense of students' understandings so that I could planfully orchestrate classroom discussions. Later, I would conduct retrospective analyses of my interactions by analyzing from the ``outside'' what I had previously participated in on the ``inside.'' In these instances, I worked to understand both the students' and my learning through normative patterns of engagement. The theoretical lens that I adopted for most of my analyses of the classroom is that of a social constructivist with a strong emphasis on tools. I find Greeno's levels of accounts of cognition in interaction strengthen my previous orientation by more clearly articulating levels of a progression of conceptual understanding. However, I am left wondering what the means of support are for shifts between the levels. Clearly, having a way to analyze the students' current abilities or ways of reasoning is crucial. However, I view it as necessary but insufficient for supporting learning. It is this stance that I take in my commentary.},

They discuss how this view of knowledge affects our understanding of learning, and they note that conventional schooling too often ignores the influence of school culture on what is learned in school. As an alternative to conventional practices, they propose "cognitive apprenticeship" (Collins, Brown, \& Newman, in press), which honors the situated nature of knowledge. They examine two examples of mathematics instruction that exhibit certain key features of this approach to teaching.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the literature related to the learning and teaching of debugging computer programs. Debugging is an important skill that continues to be both difficult for novice programmers to learn and challenging for computer science educators to teach. These challenges persist despite a wealth of important research on the subject dating back as far as the mid 1970s. Although the tools and languages novices use for writing programs today are notably different from those employed decades earlier, the basic problem-solving and pragmatic skills necessary to debug them effectively are largely similar. Hence, an understanding of the previous work on debugging can offer computer science educators insights into how to improve contemporary learning and teaching of debugging and may suggest directions for future research into this important area. This overview of the debugging literature is organized around four questions relevant to computer science educators and education researchers: What causes bugs to occur? What types of bugs occur? What is the debugging process? How can we improve the learning and teaching of debugging? We conclude with suggestions on using the existing literature both to facilitate pedagogical improvements to debugging education and to offer guidance for future research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

The author shows that the definition of the role of researchers draws heavily on a dualistic view that separates knowledge from skill and detaches human intellectual faculties from other human faculties. Although such dualistic notions are highly contested nowadays, they are institutionalized in the definition of the work of researchers and the purpose of research. The contribution of this article lies in the presentation of a unifying framework in which the views of teachers and researchers can be (at least partially) reconciled in the context of clinical research practice.},

These students, who had been taught to value the distinction between `science' and `design,' tended to resist design education.

This predisposition made it difficult for activist faculty to convince students that design introduces entirely new learning issues.

In this literature, the epistemology is generally taken as a belief or stance toward a discipline, and the affective stance applies broadly to a discipline or classroom culture. A second, emerging line of research, however, shows that a student in a given discipline can shift between multiple locally coherent epistemological stances [2]. To begin uniting these two bodies of literature, toward the long-term goal of incorporating affect into fine-grained models of in-the-moment cognitive dynamics, we present a case study of "Judy", an undergraduate engineering major. We argue that a fine-grained aspect of Judy's affect, her annoyance at a particular kind of homework problem, stabilizes a context-dependent epistemological stance she displays, about an unbridgeable gulf she perceives to exist between real and ideal circuits.},

Task holds for both sets of cerebral blood flow changes ( CBF), providing the opportunity to investigate areas that become and ''activated'' in the experimental condition relative to control state. Such data yield the intriguing observation that in areas in emotional processing, such as the amygdala, the posteromedial cortex, and the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, although flow as expected during specific emotion-related tasks, flow decreases performance of some attentionally demanding, cognitive tasks. Conversely, in some of the areas that appear to subserve cognitive functions, as the dorsal anterior cingulate and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, increases while performing attentionally demanding cognitive tasks, but during some experimentally induced and pathological emotional Although the specific nature of such reciprocal patterns of regional remains unclear, they may reflect an important cross-modal interaction during mental operations. The possibility that neural activity is less in areas required in emotional processing during some higher cognitive processes holds implications for the mechanisms underlying interactions cognition and emotion.

Learning selves is a way of characterizing how people as learners are constituted in and between settings. Focusing on the concept of self represents an attempt to address what becomes of the person in sociocultural and dialogical theorizing. Through a discussion of central concepts in dialogical theory, we outline three analytical resources to examine and identify cultural constructions of learning selves. The first is narratives, the second categories, and the last inscriptions. By working through an episode of interaction, where a teacher and his students discuss and negotiate the use of a particular learning resource in school, we demonstrate how the analytical resources enable us to study the process through which particular versions of learning selves are put together and contrasted. Finally, we discuss the implications for educational research on learning and identity.},

The focus of the study was student use of the arrow-pushing formalism that plays a central role in both the teaching and practice of organic chemistry. The goal of the study was to probe how students made sense of the arrow-pushing formalism by examining their responses to seven organic chemistry problems that required the use of this formalism. This paper discusses common barriers to students' understanding of the arrow-pushing formalism, the concepts and ideas students apply when they use this formalism to solve mechanism problems, and implications of the observation that they used this formalism in a meaningless, mechanical manner.},

  abstract = {Algebraic symbols do not speak for themselves. What one actually sees in them depends on the requirements of the problem to which they are applied. Not less important, it depends on what one is able to perceive and prepared to notice. It is this last statement which becomes the leading theme of this article. The main focus is on the versatility and adaptability of student's algebraic knowledge. The analysis is carried out within the framework of the theory of reification according to which there is an inherent process-object duality in the majority of mathematical concepts. It is the basic tenet of our theory that the operational (process-oriented) conception emerges first and that the mathematical objects (structural conceptions) develop afterward through reification of the processes. There is much evidence showing that reification is difficult to achieve. The nature and the growth of algebraic thinking is first analyzed from an epistemological perspective supported by historical observations. Eventually, its development is presented as a sequence of ever more advanced transitions from operational to structural outlook. This model is subsequently applied to the individual learning. The focus is on two crucial transitions: from the purely operational algebra to the structural algebra 'of a fixed value' (of an unknown) and then from here to the functional algebra (of a variable). The special difficulties experienced by the learner at both these junctions are illustrated with much empirical data coming from a broad range of sources.},

  shorttitle = {Schooling},
  abstract = {The sociocultural perspective on learning and development has met with some opposition, notably from those who find in it a lack of attention to the child's active construction in these processes. Since, so the claim goes, this active construction is a central tenet of constructivism \textendash{} whether that of Piaget or of von Glasersfeld \textendash{} what is needed is a ``synthesis'' of constructivism with socioculturalism. Wertsch and Kazan offer such a synthesis, a ``socioculturally situated constructivism'' in which children learn ``within the confines'' of adult expertise. In this Chapter I argue that this is not an adequate account of what occurs in the Fast Plants videos. Rather, what can be observed is an ontological construction which is invisible to constructivism. In the course of their interactions together the students actively transform a sheet of paper first into a graph and then into a distribution, a public artifact and a mathematical object, which has now been reproduced in this book. An object of knowledge has been constructed and reconstructed in complex trajectories of collective activity. In at least one group this occurred without expert guidance. Differences in the teachers' and the students' preferred forms of representation raise questions about the definition of a single use of an artifact as appropriate, and about the definition of schooling as domestication. Learning, I suggest, is not change in subjective knowledge structures, it is transformation of known objects and of knowing subjects. Although adult authority often plays a part, it would be a mistake to see schooling as merely the socialization of novices by experts.},

  abstract = {How does learning about scientists' struggles during their scientific knowledge building affect students' science learning? Two hundred and seventy-one high school students were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: (a) the struggle-oriented background information (n = 90) condition, which presented students with stories about 3 scientists' struggles in creating the content knowledge that the students were learning through online physics instructional units; (b) the achievement-oriented background information (n = 88) condition, in which students learned about these 3 scientists' lifetime achievements; and (c) a no background information (n = 93) condition, a control group in which students mainly learned information about the physics contents they were studying. Our measures assessed perceptions of scientists, interest in physics lessons, recall of science concepts, and physics problem solving. We found that the achievement-oriented background information had negative effects on students' perceptions of scientists, producing no effects on students' interest in physics lessons, recall of science concepts, or their solving of both textbook-based and complex problems. In contrast, the struggle-oriented background information helped students create perceptions of scientists as hardworking individuals who struggled to make scientific progress. In addition, it also increased students' interest in science, increased their delayed recall of the key science concepts, and improved their abilities to solve complex problems. The important message that learning about scientists' struggles sends is that even great scientists work hard. Providing an opportunity for students to relate scientists to their knowledge-building activities has important implications for science learning and instruction.

The course is divided into three parts with approximately five weeks each: (1) introduction to Programming, (2) introduction to Object-Oriented programming and Graphical Unit Interface (GUI) programming, and (3) the final project, which includes the design and implementation of a computer game. The computer language used in the course is JAVA. The course is designed with Problem Base Learning to incentive students' creativity and learning. The course provides the students with opportunities to engage in problem solving, team discussions, collaborative work, and critical thinking. In addition, the students are challenged to identify and find solutions to their programming problems. This approach should help to prepare students to enter in a field that is rapidly changing, and where they will be required to constantly learn new things and to take initiative. The session will present some samples of class assignments and final projects as well as a summary of the survey conducted with students enrolled in the course.},

  abstract = {Abstract  Students in a mathematics classroom are motivated to do many things, not only the ones we expect them to do. In order to understand student behaviour in classrooms we need to increase our understanding of what motivation is and how it is regulated. Two issues relevant to a critique of mainstream motivation research need consideration: (a) the importance of the unconscious in motivation and (b) focusing on motivational states and processes rather than traits. In the present paper, motivation is conceptualised as a potential to direct behaviour through the mechanisms that control emotion. As a potential, motivation cannot be directly observed. It is observable only as it manifests itself in affect and cognition, for example as beliefs, values and emotional reactions. This potential is structured through needs and goals. Based on this view of motivation and the author's earlier studies, three aspects of motivation regulation are discussed. Primarily, goals are derived from needs: in learning situations, the psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and social belonging are the most significant determinants of goal choices. As a second aspect, this view accepts the influence of students' beliefs about the accessibility of different goals. As a third aspect, the influence of automatic emotional reactions for goal regulation will be discussed. The case of Frank will be used 1) to illustrate how motivation can be inferred from different kinds of data and 2) as an example of how conflicting goals lead to non-straightforward self-regulation.},

  abstract = {The creation of plan schemas is examined in a naturalistic, longitudinal study of problem solving. Ten novice programmers each wrote eight Pascal programs to solve a series of problems. Their protocols were analyzed to determine how declarative programming knowledge was used to create simple procedural program plans, and how the simple plans were used to create complex plans. Plan creation showed a process of backward development, from the goal to the plan focus, that part of the plan that directly implements the goal. Once defined, it is expanded to create the complete plan, showing backward development of plan parts from the focus. Once the plan is complete, it may be stored as a plan schema and retrieved in subsequent problem solving. The plan will then show forward development as it is implemented in schema order, the order in which plan pieces occur in the finished program. The change from backward development during creation to forward development after retrieval was strongly evident in the statistical analysis of the protocol data. Previous studies of novice programming, which showed only forward development, are explained as special cases of this more general model, cases in which schema knowledge was available to the problem solver.},

Although the computer has been touted as the technology that will effectively develop both the declarative and procedural knowledge needed to establish good problem solvers, research supporting this claim has been slow to materialize. Several reasons for the lack of significant research findings are discussed. Many studies have not been sufficiently grounded in problem-solving theory. The question of expertise and transfer of training is also addressed. Other issues critical to successfully designing programming language/problem-solving research include (a) treatment-related issues, such as the method and duration of programming instruction; (b) language-related issues--that is, selecting the most beneficial programming language; and (c) selection of an appropriate sample.},

  abstract = {The research reported here investigates variation in first year university students' early experiences of learning to program, with a particular focus on revealing differences in how they go about learning to program. A phenomenographic research approach was used to reveal variation in how the act of learning to program may be constituted amongst first year university students. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with students who had either recently completed, or were enrolled in, a university-level introductory programming subject. Analysis revealed that students might go about learning to program in any of five different ways: by (1) Following -- where learning to program is experienced as 'getting through' the unit, (2) Coding -- where learning to program is experienced as learning to code, (3) Understanding and integrating --where learning to program is experienced as learning to write a program through understanding and integrating concepts, (4) Problem solving -- where learning to program is experienced as learning to do what it takes to solve a problem, and (5) Participating or enculturation -- where learning to program is experienced as discovering what it means to become a programmer. The relationships between these different approaches to learning are represented diagrammatically. The mapping of the variation constitutes a framework within which one aspect of the teaching and learning of introductory programming, how students go about it, may be understood. Implications for teaching and learning in introductory university curricula are discussed. They include the following points: 1) What are the critical ways in which we want students to experience learning to program in our subjects or units or instruction, or at particular points in courses? 2) What are the implications, for students, of certain ways of experiencing the act of learning to program? 3) How can curriculum support ways of going about learning? 4) How can we help students move to...

How can a course on engineering ethics affect the development of an undergraduate student's professional identity? In this project, students responded to questions about the characteristics and responsibilities of professional engineers. The results indicate that students learn about professionalism primarily from relatives and co-workers who are engineers, and rarely from technical engineering courses. Even before they study engineering ethics, students put honesty and integrity on par with technical competence as an essential characteristic of engineers. In the course, students benefit from cases of actual incidents and from classroom activities that encourage diverse perspectives on moral problems. By analyzing cases in groups and by hearing different perspectives, students build self-confidence in moral reasoning. By the end of the course, some students understand professional responsibility not only as liability for blame but in a capacious sense as stewardship for society.},

  abstract = {This article offers a plausible domain-general explanation for why some concepts of processes are resistant to instructional remediation although other, apparently similar concepts are more easily understood. The explanation assumes that processes may differ in ontological ways: that some processes (such as the apparent flow in diffusion of dye in water) are emergent and other processes (such as the flow of blood in human circulation) are direct. Although precise definition of the two kinds of processes are probably impossible, attributes of direct and emergent processes are described that distinguish them in a domain-general way. Circulation and diffusion, which are used as examples of direct and emergent processes, are associated with different kinds of misconceptions. The claim is that students' misconceptions for direct kinds of processes, such as blood circulation, are of the same ontological kind as the correct conception, suggesting that misconceptions of direct processes may be nonrobust. However, students' misconceptions of emergent processes are robust because they misinterpret emergent processes as a kind of commonsense direct processes. To correct such a misconception requires a re-representation or a conceptual shift across ontological kinds. Therefore, misconceptions of emergent processes are robust because such a shift requires that students know about the emergent kind and can overcome their (perhaps even innate) predisposition to conceive of all processes as a direct kind. Such a domain-general explanation suggests that teaching students the causal structure underlying emergent processes may enable them to recognize and understand a variety of emergent processes for which they have robust misconceptions, such as concepts of electricity, heat and temperature, and evolution.},

We argue that by choosing video clips, posing substantive questions, and facilitating productive conversations, professional developers can guide teachers to examine central aspects of learning and instruction. We draw primarily from our experiences developing and studying two mathematics PD programs, the Problem-Solving Cycle (PSC) and Learning and Teaching Geometry (LTG). While both programs feature classroom video in a central role, they illustrate different approaches to practice-based PD. The PSC, an adaptive model of PD, provides a framework within which facilitators tailor activities to suit their local context. By contrast, LTG is a highly specified model of PD, which details in advance particular learning goals, design characteristics, and extensive support materials for facilitators. We propose a continuum of video use in PD from highly adaptive to highly specified and consider the affordances and constraints of different approaches exemplified by the PSC and LTG programs.},

Initial predictions from the theory were tested by instructing small groups of students for about 2 weeks. As predicted, (a) most students were able to acquire the first two processes, (b) these processes generated correct performance and transferred to novel tasks, and (c) it was more difficult for students to acquire the semantic-based processes once they had routinized syntactic processes.

We argue that the nature of situated learning and cognition cannot be fully understood by focusing only on social, cultural
and contextual factors. These factors are themselves further situated and made comprehensible by the shared biology and fundamental
bodily experiences of human beings. Thus cognition itself is embodied, and the bodily-grounded nature of cognition provides
a foundation for social situatedness, entails a reconceptualization of cognition and mathematics itself, and has important
consequences for mathematics education. After framing some theoretical notions of embodied cognition in the perspective of
modern cognitive science, we analyze a case study \textendash{} continuity of functions. We use conceptual metaphor theory to show how
embodied cognition, while providing grounding for situatedness, also gives fruitful results in analyzing the cognitive difficulties
underlying the understanding of continuity.},

Four hundred twenty-one seventh-grade and 492 eighth-grade students were given a test consisting of eight directional and eight proportion-related word problems and a fraction test that included 11 items that precisely paralleled the mathematical structure of the word problems. The correlation between the directional and numerical scales was .38 for seventh grade and .45 for eighth grade. Regression analysis indicated that a high directional score is related to greater numerical success on proportion-related problems. The low correlations between the mathematically similar problems on the fraction and word-problem tests indicate that students are not capitalizing on the structural similarities inherent in the problems, even when the numerical quantities are identical.},

  abstract = {This article seeks to illuminate a crossover area between subject research and scholarship of teaching'. It proposes that a strategic bridge between discipline as body of knowledge and discipline as pedagogy is the formation and socialization of the student through practices that are at once social, rhetorical, and intellectual. While acknowledging that many current formations are generic, and stem from extra-disciplinary priorities, the article takes two case studies from the history of English Literary Studies. In each of the two moments explored (the 1930s and the 1980s), radical change in the subject was closely tied to the formation of paradigmatic identities for the student. In each case, radical change in the knowledge base and practice of subject professionals was mirrored in changes of practice in the classroom. Learners were socialized into a sense of belonging through rituals of opposition: in the one case to the perceived perils of mass culture, in the other to the collusions attributed to the chief practitioners of their own discipline. While actual students inevitably need to negotiate their own path through the discourses into which they are being socialized, the article argues the importance of close attention to the rituals of initiation into an academic tribe'.},

Through contrastive analyses between Slavin's representations of the program evaluation synthesis efforts of five organizations and their own representations of their synthesis work, the authors uncover the ways in which the gaps in Slavin's text become consequential for readers, limiting readers' opportunities for developing understandings of synthesis efforts. Through contrastive analyses, the authors foreground the need for transparency in reporting, raise questions about the use of narrowly focused reviews, and demonstrate how a contrastive analysis of texts may constitute a productive approach to critical reading and an opportunity for learning.},

We argue that part of what makes the current wave of interest a movement and not just the latest educational fad is that teacher research stems from several different, but in some ways compatible, intellectual traditions and educational projects. We identify five major trends that characterize the current U.S. movement: (a) the prominence of teacher research in teacher education, professional development, and school reform; (b) the development of conceptual frameworks and theories of teacher research; (c) the dissemination of teacher research beyond the local level; (d) the emergence of critique of teacher research and the teacher research movement; and (e) the transformative potential of teacher research on some aspects of university culture. Based on our own teacher research experiences and understandings of teacher research, we conclude with thoughts about the future of the movement in the face of the standards movement and other current reforms that create an educational climate quite different from that of a decade ago.},

Schommer epistemological questionnaire. We conducted post-hoc power analysis and present the evidence that the lack of associations
should not be attributed to the lack of power. Overall, our results suggest that reflective thinking and moral reasoning represent
separate dimensions of cognitive process which develop at a different pace. Thus, a stand-alone course of ethics in accounting
education is warranted since higher moral reasoning does not automatically follow from extended technical education and improved
critical thinking skills.},

I argue that our current notions of rigor overemphasize certain types of rigor at the expense of others and that design-based research provides an opportunity to select different inferential trade-offs. I describe how 1 design-based research trajectory evolved over time in a way that helped ensure that the learning theories being studied were well represented by the planned interventions and that the interpretation of outcomes was grounded in an understanding of not only the research design, but how the research played out in practice when enacted in real classrooms.},

While it might be reasonable to expect general chemistry students to struggle with this abstract concept, it is surprising that upper-level students in analytical chemistry and biochemistry continue to struggle even though buffers are taught in many chemistry classes in an undergraduate program. Anecdotal evidence indicates that this is the case; however, little research exists to describe or explain students' difficulties with buffers. The goal of the research presented in this paper is to determine how undergraduate general chemistry, analytical chemistry, and biochemistry students perceive buffers and buffer problems. In order to examine students' experiences with buffers and buffer problems, we first interviewed students about how they understand and visualize buffer systems. We then asked the students to think aloud as they solved buffer problems and to reflect on what they do and do not understand about buffers. Here, we discuss students' ideas about buffers and how they function, the misconceptions students have about buffers and buffer problems, and the types of support students need to understand buffers and solve buffer problems.},

  doi = {10.1207/s1532690xci1504_2},
  abstract = {Teachers interested in promoting student inquiry often feel a tension between that agenda and the more traditional agenda of "covering the content." Efforts in education reform devote substantial time to addressing this tension, primarily through curriculum reform, paring the traditional content and adopting inquiry-oriented methods. Discovery learning approaches, in particular, are designed to engage students in inquiry through which, guided by the teacher and materials, they "discover" the intended content. Still, the tension remains, for example, in moments where students make discoveries other than as intended.

How teachers experience and negotiate these moments depends largely on their expectations of curriculum and instruction. For some, successful instruction entails progress through a planned set of observations and ideas, and such moments of divergence may represent impediments. Others see the classroom as an arena, not only for student exploration but also for teacher exploration, of the students' understanding and reasoning, of the subject matter, of what constitutes progress toward expertise and how to facilitate that progress. For them, successful instruction depends on teachers' often unanticipated perceptions and insights. One might call this discovery teaching.

This article presents a detailed account of a week of learning and instruction from my high school physics course to provide a context for discussion of the role and demands of teacher inquiry. For the view supported here, the coordination of student inquiry and traditional content is not simply a matter of reducing the latter and welcoming the former. It is a matter of discerning and responding to students' particular strengths and needs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND As estimates continue to indicate a growing demand for engineering professionals, retention in engineering remains an issue. Thus, the engineering education community remains concerned about students who leave engineering and must work to identify the factors that influence those students' decisions. PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS) Our purpose was to identify a set of factors describing the experiences of students' in a college of engineering that are strong influences on decisions to leave and study how those factors are related to both predictor variables (e.g., high school preparation) and future behaviors (e.g., new major chosen). DESIGN/METHOD We solicited survey data from students who had recently transferred out of a large engineering college. We conducted exploratory factor analysis to determine the main factors for leaving engineering and then used these factors to answer the research questions. RESULTS Results indicate that both academic (e.g., curriculum difficulty and poor teaching and advising) and a non-academic factor (lack of belonging in engineering) contribute to students' decisions to leave engineering. We did find differences for some factors between majority and non-majority students; however, there were no gender differences. CONCLUSIONS Both academic and non-academic factors contribute to students' decisions to leave engineering; however, our sample indicated the non-academic factors may be a stronger influence. Implications for educators focus on addressing both academic and the belonging factor and include examining pedagogical activities that may be less welcoming to a wide variety of student groups, providing opportunities for meaningful faculty interaction and other activities designed to support students pursuing engineering degrees.

In studying designers at work, the authors observed breadth- versus depth-first approaches to design-space exploration and problem- versus solution-driven approaches during the actual design. Which approaches and when to use them are important to effective design. The authors suggest four archetypical strategies that designers can choose under different circumstances, thus making design strategy one of the early design decisions.},

I first draw on Dewey's pragmatism to clarify the criterion of usefulness as explanatory power that I use to assess the potential contributions of Clancey's transactional perspective to the collective enterprise of mathematics education. I then focus on specific aspects of Clancey's transactional perspective to illustrate its relevance in orienting instructional design and the analysis of learning in classroom settings.},

Measures of software quality and software complexity to be used in this modeling process exhibit systematic departures of the normality assumptions of regression modeling. Two new estimation procedures are introduced, and their performances in the modeling of software quality from software complexity in terms of the predictive quality and the quality of fit are compared with those of the more traditional least squares and least absolute value estimation techniques. The two new estimation techniques did produce regression models with better quality of fit and predictive quality when applied to data obtained from two software development projects},

In this article, we present a meta-emotion perspective as an essential component of a conceptual framework on self-regulation that fully acknowledges the role of emotions. Against this background, a study is presented that attempts to contribute to the clarification of the relevance and the functioning of students' meta-emotional knowledge and emotional regulation skills in school-related mathematical activities. It investigates the coping strategies that 393 students of the second (age 14) and fourth (age 16) year of secondary school report to use to regulate their emotions in three different mathematical school settings (i.e., a mathematics test, a difficult mathematics homework, and a difficult mathematics lesson). More specifically, it aims (1) to document the nature and frequency of the reported coping strategies, and (2) to explore\textemdash{}for the three different mathematical school settings\textemdash{}relationships between these reported coping strategies and personal characteristics (i.e., students' familiarity with the particular school settings, their track in secondary education, their achievement level, their age, and gender). The results indicate that students report to know and to make use of several coping strategies in school-related mathematical activities, and reveal that the use of these strategies is related to specific person-related characteristics. In conclusion, we elaborate on how schools and teachers can stimulate students to acquire appropriate strategies and skills to self-regulate their emotions.},

Misconceptions constructivists view the prior knowledge as stable alternate conceptions that apply robustly across multiple contexts. By contrast, fine-grained constructivists believe that much of students' intuitive knowledge consists of unarticulated, loosely connected knowledge elements, the activation of which depends sensitively on context. By focusing on students' intuitive knowledge about representations, and by fleshing out the two constructivist frameworks, I show that they lead to empirically different sets of predictions. Pilot studies demonstrate the feasibility of a full-fledged experimental program to decide which flavor of constructivism describes students more adequately.},

We analysed these protocols to document and compare the student design processes. The results show that the seniors produced higher quality designs. In addition, compared to the freshmen, the seniors gathered more information, considered more alternative solutions, transitioned more frequently between design steps and progressed further into the final steps of the design process.},

  volume = {1},
  isbn = {978-1-4419-7582-9},
  abstract = {In this chapter I put forward a dialogic theory of education that focuses on the process of drawing children into those kind of relationships that help them to see things from other points of view. I contrast this theory to Wertsch and Kazak's Vygotsky-Shpet perspective which gives a central role to mediating cultural objects such as sign-tools. I argue that while tools can be important, the quality of the learning relationship is more fundamental. I begin by distinguishing Bakhtin's dialogic perspective from Vygotsky's more dialectic perspective. While dialectic can look like dialogic it is different in not respecting the essential otherness of the other and so ends by subsuming the other into the development of the self. I then offer a critique of the Vygotsky subject-tool-object mediation triangle. For an object to serve as a `sign-tool' presupposes a prior relationship between people within which signs can be interpreted as having a meaning. The significance of this is then illustrated in a re-analysis of the same episodes of classroom talk that Wertsch and Kazak analyze in their earlier chapter. Whereas their analysis claims to show the importance of the graph-paper as a cultural tool engaging learners at different levels of understanding my re-analysis suggests that they learnt to understand how to use the graph paper through the careful establishment of intersubjectivity both in teacher led sessions and in small group work. I conclude that while learning how to use pre-existing cultural tools is one aspect of education it is too limited a perspective to serve as a general theory of education. By contrast the more truly dialogic theory of education that I propose shows how children can learn to think, learn to learn and learn to be creative through the process of being drawn into dialogue where dialogue is not only considered as a means to constructing knowledge but also as an end in itself.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, design experimentation has become an increasingly accepted mode of research appropriate for the theoretical and empirical study of learning amidst complex educational interventions as they are enacted in everyday settings. There is still a significant lack of clarity surrounding methodological and epistemological features of this body of work. In fact, there is a broad variety of theory being developed in this mode of research. In contrast to recent efforts to seek a singular definition for design experimentation, I argue that methodological and epistemological issues are significantly more tractable if considered from the perspective of manifold families of theoretically framed design-based research. After characterizing a range of such families, I suggest that, as we deliberate on the nature of design-based research, greater attention should be given to the pluralistic nature of learning theory, to the relation between theory and method, and to working across theoretical and methodological boundaries through the use of mixed methods. Finally, I suggest that design-based research-with its focus on promoting, sustaining, and understanding innovation in the world-should be considered a form of scholarly inquiry that sits alongside the panoply of canonical forms ranging from the experimental, historical, philosophical, sociological, legal, and interpretive.},

More specifically, undergraduate students' approaches are analyzed as the students fill in an operation table for four elements--a, b, c, and d--in such a way that it represents a group of order four. The data are analyzed from the perspective of reducing abstraction, which aims to explain students' conceptions of abstract algebra concepts. From this perspective, most students' responses and conceptions can be attributed to their tendency to work on a lower level of abstraction than the level on which concepts are introduced in class.$<$/p$>$},

         That human social interaction involves the intertwined 
cooperation of different modalities is uncontroversial. Researchers in several 
allied fields have, however, only recently begun to document the precise ways in 
which talk, gesture, gaze, and aspects of the material surround are brought 
together to form coherent courses of action. The papers in this volume are 
attempts to develop this line of inquiry. Although the authors draw on a range 
of analytic, theoretical, and methodological traditions (conversation analysis, 
ethnography, distributed cognition, and workplace studies), all are concerned to 
explore and illuminate the inherently multimodal character of social 
interaction. Recent studies, including those collected in this volume, suggest 
that different modalities work together not only to elaborate the semantic 
content of talk but also to constitute coherent courses of action. In this 
introduction we present evidence for this position. We begin by reviewing some 
select literature focusing primarily on communicative functions and interactive 
organizations of specific modalities before turning to consider the integration 
of distinct modalities in interaction.},

Children's view of experimentation, their approach to exploration, and their negotiation of competing knowledge claims, are interpreted in terms of categories of epistemological reasoning. Children's epistemological reasoning is distinguished from their ability to control variables. While individual children differ substantially, they show a relatively steady growth in their reasoning, with some contextual variation. A number of these children are reasoning at a level well in advance of curriculum expectations, and it is argued that current recommended practice in primary science needs to be rethought. The data is used to explore the relationship between reasoning and knowledge, and to argue that the generation and exploration of ideas must be the key driver of scientific activity in the primary school.

A dynamic systems approach in contrast focuses on the self-organization of behavior in tasks. This article uses recent results concerning the embodiment of cognition to argue for a dynamic systems approach. The embodiment hypothesis is the idea that intelligence emerges in the interaction of an organism with an environment and as a result of sensory-motor activity. The continual coupling of cognition to the world through the body both adapts cognition to the idiosyncrasies of the here and now, makes it relevant, and provides the mechanism for developmental change.},

Second, we examine the relationship between epistemological beliefs and learning in order to understand why such beliefs are important to educators.

  abstract = {The representational view of mind in mathematics education is evidenced by theories that characterize learning as a process in which students modify their internal mental representations to construct mathematical relationships or structures that mirror those embodied in external instructional representations. It is argued that, psychologically, this view falls prey to the learning paradox, that, anthropologically, it fails to consider the social and cultural nature of mathematical activity and that, pedagogically, it leads to recommendations that are at odds with the espoused goal of encouraging learning with understanding. These difficulties are seen to arise from the dualism created between mathematics in students' heads and mathematics in their environment. An alternative view is then outlined and illustrated that attempts to transcend this dualism by treating mathematics as both an individual, constructive activity and as a communal, social practice. It is suggested that such an approach might make it possible to explain how students construct mathematical meanings and practices that, historically, took several thousand years to evolve without attributing to students the ability to peek around their internal representations and glimpse a mathematically prestructured environment. In addition, it is argued that this approach might offer a way to go beyond the traditional tripartite scheme of the teacher, the student, and mathematics that has traditionally guided reform efforts in mathematics education.},

@article{clark_african_2013,
  title = {African {{American Mathematics Teachers}} as {{Agents}} in {{Their African American Students}}' {{Mathematics Identity Formation}}},
  abstract = {Background/Context: Recent research in mathematics education has employed sociocultural and historical lenses to better understand how students experience school mathematics and come to see themselves as capable mathematics learners. This work has identified mathematics classrooms as places where power struggles related to students' identities occur, struggles that often involve students' affiliations with racial, ethnic, and gender categories and the mathematics teacher as a critical agent in students' mathematics identity development. Frameworks for identifying resources that mathematics teachers draw on to teach are evolving, and emerging dimensions of teachers' knowledge, namely knowledge of students' lived experiences and histories, as well as teachers' experiences and identities, are increasingly being considered alongside more traditional dimensions of the knowledge teachers draw on in their practice.

Purpose: The purpose of this article is to explore the perspectives and practices of two African American mathematics teachers, Madison Morgan and Floyd Lee, as they support their African American students' mathematics identity formation and development.

Participants: At the time of the study, Morgan and Lee were high school mathematics teachers in a large urban school district. Both participants were selected for this analysis because of considerable differences in their life histories, pedagogical approaches, and perspectives.

Research Design: Each teacher was observed approximately 25 times and interviewed 9\textendash{}10 times. The primary data for this analysis consist of a subset of observations and interviews for the purposes of conducting a qualitative cross-case analysis that examines themes, similarities, and differences in Morgan's and Lee's approaches to supporting their students' mathematics identity development.

Findings: Morgan's and Lee's experiences, perspectives, and practices characterize two very different perspectives of what constitutes a positive mathematics identity, while both maintain connections to race and racial identities. In both cases, there exists a subtle paradox in the underlying motivations that the teachers communicated in their interviews related to socializing their African American students and the practices they actually employ in their classrooms. Furthermore, both teachers made use of their capacity to serve as models and motivators for students' current and future success in mathematics.

Conclusions/Recommendations: If equitable high-quality mathematics instruction is a sincere goal of the mathematics education community, we strongly recommend that researchers further explore the ways that teacher identity, including those dimensions associated with race, class, and gender, serves as an instructional and motivational resource as teachers work to create productive and meaningful learning environments for their students.},

Learning proofs and counterexamples within the domain of continuous functions is important because students encounter continuous functions in many mathematics courses.

Few of these research studies, however, have focused on undergraduates' abilities to produce proofs and counterexamples in the domain of continuous functions. The goal of this study is to contribute to research on student productions of proofs and counterexamples and to identify their abilities and mathematical understandings. The findings suggest more attention should be paid to teaching and learning proofs and counterexamples, as participants showed difficulty in writing these statements. More importantly, the analysis provides insight into the design of curriculum and instruction that may improve undergraduates' learning in advanced mathematics courses.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to identify the concerns of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) career changers to better inform teacher education programs on how to best address their unique needs. We identified three career-changers with former STEM-related careers, each seeking a secondary teaching credential in biology and currently enrolled in a post-baccalaureate fifth-year secondary-level credential program. Data were collected using a variety of qualitative methods including open-ended interviews and non-participant observations. Teaching portfolios (including employment resumes and program assignments and lesson plans) and academic transcripts were also collected. Qualitative data were analyzed by organizing the data into topics, codes, and then categories based upon predetermined themes from the research questions and emergent themes from the data set. A case for each career changer was then developed and further analyzed for similarities and differences. This study raises questions about designing alternative certification programs exclusively for second career teachers. The findings of this study in several ways agreed with other literature on the reluctance of career-changers to become students again; however, this study presented an alternate picture as well. Two of the three study participants expressed initial misgivings about their needs to enter a credential program because of either their previous experiences in working with youth or teaching at the university level. However, by the end of the first semester of student teaching, all three saw the value in learning about students especially when working with diverse student populations. In conclusion, we found that these STEM career changers benefited by entering the teaching profession alongside more traditional peers in the credential program. A longer term and future goal is to follow these individuals into their teaching careers to determine if their collegial experiences inthe credential program are related to the development of their teacher identity and what impact that may have on their success in the classroom and on teacher retention.},

Results indicated that students who were exposed to the metacognitive instruction within cooperative learning (COOP+META) significantly outperformed their counterparts who were exposed to cooperative learning with no metacognitive instruction (COOP). The positive effects of COOP+META were observed on both graph interpretation and graph construction (transfer task) with regard to alternative conceptions. Furthermore, observations indicated differential characteristics of discourse behaviors during small group interaction under these methods. The practical implications of the study are discussed.

Research suggests that students' ways of knowing and beliefs about what counts as knowing and learning \textendash{} their personal epistemologies \textendash{} can be aspects of their identities, or sense of self as knowers and learners. Purpose/Hypothesis Combining personal epistemology and identity theories suggests epistemological aspects of students' identities can influence whether they feel they belong in their engineering program. We have two research questions: Can a high-achieving engineering student be in danger of leaving a program because of a mismatch between epistemological aspects of his identity and his perceptions of the intellectual climate of their program? How does such a mismatch affect the student's day-to-day academic experiences? Design/Method For three years, we followed Michael, an electrical engineering student, through interviews and in-class observations. From more than 12 hours of semistructured clinical interviews, more than 10 hours of videotaped discussion sections, and two in-class observations in lectures, we produced a case study to characterize epistemological aspects of Michael's identity and how they influenced his perception of his program. Results Michael expressed and enacted a sense-making epistemology that is a fundamental aspect of his identity as a learner. Due to this sense-making aspect of Michael's identity, he often felt alienated from the intellectual climate of his program, and he considered leaving engineering. Conclusion Researchers focused on student retention should attend to epistemological aspects of student identities. Instructors and administrators focused on retention should attend to the epistemological messages students hear from their programs.},

Great interviewing is deceptively difficult, partly because it is an acquired ability that takes time to develop, partly because people often remain bound to conventional norms of behavior while interviewing that precludes open access to the people interviewed. While several texts are available on interviewing, few of them venture to draw the explicit distinction among characteristics that separate ordinary from outstanding interviews. Consequently, a concise and accessible guidepost that directs people to the essentials of outstanding interviewing is difficult to find. Based on interviews with a range of people about varied subjects, the author offers 25 directions that will, when followed in combination, point the interviewer along the road from the good (or not-so-good) interview to the great interview.},

  abstract = {Proposes a theory of motivation and emotion in which causal ascriptions play a key role. Evidence is presented indicating that in achievement-related contexts there are a few dominant causal perceptions, and it is suggested that the perceived causes of success and failure share the 3 common properties of locus, stability, and controllability, with intentionality and globality as other possible causal structures. The perceived stability of causes influences changes in expectancy of success; all 3 dimensions of causality affect a variety of common emotional experiences, including anger, gratitude, guilt, hopelessness, pity, pride, and shame. Expectancy and affect, in turn, are presumed to guide motivated behavior. The theory therefore relates the structure of thinking to the dynamics of feeling and action. Analysis of a created motivational episode involving achievement strivings is offered, and numerous empirical observations are examined from this theoretical position. The strength of the empirical evidence and the capability of this theory to address prevalent human emotions are stressed, and examples of research on parole decisions, smoking cessation, and helping behavior are presented to illustrate the generalizability of the theory beyond the achievement-related theoretical focus.

Such analogical transfer, however, has been difficult to demonstrate empirically, even within a single experimental session. This article proposes a framework for conceptualizing analogical problem solving that can account for the conflicting findings in the literature. In addition, the framework leads to two predictions concerning the transfer behavior of experts and novices. These predictions concern both positive and negative transfer and are based on the different types of features included in the problem representations of experts and novices. First, when two problems share structural features but not surface features, spontaneous positive transfer should be more likely in experts than in novices. Second, when two problems share surface but not structural features, spontaneous negative transfer should be stronger for novices than for experts. These predictions were supported by the results of three experiments involving college students solving a complex arithmetic word problem.

This study relates an amalgam of theories on learning and gender to the context of engineering education. Based on data from a qualitative study of an electrical and electronics engineering study programme, this study found that studying engineering in a PBL environment involves not only the mastery of technological knowledge but also an engineering identity development process. However, the association of an engineering identity with masculinity and the culturally defined engineering competencies leads to different learning experiences for male and female students. The nature of hard-core engineering subjects, based on male interests, privileges men and acts as a barrier to women. The masculine culture in engineering communities of practice involves more effort in identity management for women students than their male peers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Three types of validity evidence were obtained for (a) representativeness of multi-step engineering design processes in eliciting self-efficacy, (b) the instrument's ability to differentiate groups of individuals with different levels of engineering experience, and (c) relationships between self-efficacy, motivation, outcome expectancy, and anxiety as predicted by self-efficacy theory.ResultsResults indicate that the instrument can reliably identify individuals' engineering design self-efficacy ($\alpha$ = 0.967), motivation ($\alpha$ = 0.955), outcome expectancy ($\alpha$ = 0.967), and anxiety ($\alpha$ = 0.940). One-way ANOVA identified statistical differences in self-efficacy between high, intermediate, and low experience groups at the $\rho$ $<$ 0.05 level. Self-efficacy was also shown to be correlated to motivation (0.779), outcome expectancy (0.919), and anxiety (\textemdash{}0.593) at the $\rho$ $<$ 0.01 level.ConclusionsThe study showed that the instrument was capable of identifying individuals' self-concepts specific to the engineering design tasks.},

  abstract = {We investigated the development of two-dimensional space concepts within a mathematics unit on grids, coordinates, and rectangles, part of a large-scale curriculum development project funded by the NSF. Data from case studies, interviews, paper-and-pencil tests, and whole-class observations were collected during field tests with 4 fourth-grade classrooms. Students had to overcome substantial hurdles in learning to spatially structure two-dimensional grids, including interpreting the grid's components as line segments rather than regions; appreciating the precision of location the lines required, rather than treating them as fuzzy boundaries or indicators of intervals; and learning to trace vertical or horizontal lines that were not axes. We found no evidence for a relationship between students' strategies for naming and locating coordinates and their other knowledge of grid and coordinate systems; instead, such knowledge was related to students' levels of competence in three aspects of more complex coordinate situations: number sense, spatial-geometric relationships, and the ability to discriminate and integrate the two numbers constituting a coordinate pair and the two axes constituting a coordinate plane. On this basis we describe elements of students' mental structuring of grid and coordinate systems as two-dimensional spaces, demarcated and measured with conceptual rulers. Relationships between students' conceptualizations and various representations, including real-world analogies, were complex, with the real-world contexts serving an important scaffolding role for most students at the early phases of learning, but impeding further mathematical abstraction in some students at later phases. Computer representations were significant in aiding learning, especially mathematical generalization and abstraction, in both grid and coordinate systems and in the learning of concepts of rectangles. Teacher and computer scaffolding also played a critical role in... [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {This paper describes lessons from stories of thirty-six women in engineering and six women in computer science narrated in our book on journeys of women in science and engineering.1 These stories underscore the various factors that have been described in the literature as reasons women choose and stay in engineering. This paper discusses several of these factors.
Students who reach college are a select group who have overcome the early barriers and are set on a potential track to becoming engineers. The experiences of these women as narrated in the book point to some ofthe positive and negative factors in the formative stages of their lives. Albert Bandura's model of perceived self-efficacy is a theoretical frame work that may be useful in exploring ways of teaching and advising in engineering schools to better meet the needs of the increasingly diverse student population. This framework is discussed briefly, and its components illustrated by examples from the stories. As college advisors and teachers, we need to reaffirm the methods and thinking students have evolved, but which may be challenged by the system based on a "normative student" model.},

The basic principle of distributed representations Is that the representational system of a distributed cognitive task is a set of internal and external representations, which together represent the abstract structure of the task. The basic strategy of representational analysis is to decompose the representation of a hierarchical task into its component levels so that the representational properties at each level can be independently examined. The theoretical framework and the methodology are used to analyze the hierarchical structure of the Tower of Hanoi problem. Based on this analysis, four experiments are designed to examine the representational properties of the Tower of Hanoi. Finally, the nature of external representations is discussed.},

The analysis focuses first on the initial state of boys and girls in terms of their prior experience and the perception they have of their abilities in science and technology, then on the change in their performance (i.e. the conceptual shifts that take place) and the FOK of these same groups as they participate in ``electronic problem-solving'' activities. The results seem to indicate that this pedagogical approach produces the same results among both sexes in terms of learning acquisition, but favors boys in terms of the certainty they have of the solutions they provide.},

The 'constraints and affordances' provided by different environments are shown to be key analytical tools in understanding the ways in which students develop and make use of knowledge. Various classroom incidents are analysed, demonstrating that the particular constraints and affordances of formalised mathematics classrooms, to which students become attuned, contribute to the development of learning identities that are peculiar to the school mathematics classroom and of limited use to students in the 'real world'. An understanding of the mathematics classroom as a particular community of practice is central to this analysis.},

Three of those misconceptions are detailed in this paper: two misconceptions about memory models, and data assignment when primitives are declared. Individual misconceptions are related, but vary widely, thus providing excellent material to use in the development of the CI. In addition, CS1 instructors are provided immediate usable material for helping their students understand some difficult introductory concepts.},

Here we describe a novel approach to study the dynamics and evolution of scientific fields using a network-based analysis. We build an idea network consisting of American Physical Society PACS numbers as nodes representing scientific concepts. Two PACS numbers are linked if there exist publications that reference them simultaneously. We locate scientific fields using Cfinder, a community finding algorithm, and describe the time evolution of these fields using a community evolution method over the course of 1985-2006. The communities we identify map to known scientific fields, and their age strongly depends on their size, impact and activity. Our analysis further shows that communities that redefine themselves by merging and creating new groups of ideas tend to have more fitness as measured by the impact per paper, and hence communities with a higher fitness tend to be short-lived. The described approach to quantify the evolution of ideas may be relevant in making predictions about the future of science and how to guide its development.},

  abstract = {Despite the growing number of systems providing visual analytic support for investigative analysis, few empirical studies of the potential benefits of such systems have been conducted, particularly controlled, comparative evaluations. Determining how such systems foster insight and sensemaking is important for their continued growth and study, however. Furthermore, studies that identify how people use such systems and why they benefit (or not) can help inform the design of new systems in this area. We conducted an evaluation of the visual analytics system Jigsaw employed in a small investigative sensemaking exercise, and we compared its use to three other more traditional methods of analysis. Sixteen participants performed a simulated intelligence analysis task under one of the four conditions. Experimental results suggest that Jigsaw assisted participants to analyze the data and identify an embedded threat. We describe different analysis strategies used by study participants and how computational support (or the lack thereof) influenced the strategies. We then illustrate several characteristics of the sensemaking process identified in the study and provide design implications for investigative analysis tools based thereon. We conclude with recommendations for metrics and techniques for evaluating other visual analytics investigative analysis tools.},

For this study, we asked students on the first day of a CS1 class to describe in English how they would arrange a set of numbers in ascending, sorted order; we then repeated the experiment asking students to sort a list of dates (in mm/dd/yyyy format).We found that a majority of students described a coherent algorithm; some described versions of insertion or selection sort, but many gave unexpected algorithms. We also found significant differences between responses given for sorting numbers versus dates. Based on our analysis of the data we suggest that beginning-programming instructors more explicitly discuss data types, begin loop instruction with post-test loops, assist students in recognizing implicit conditional and iteration use in natural language solutions to probls, and recognize that novices and experts focus on different aspects of the probl in even basic probl solving tasks.},

  abstract = {My goal is to contribute to concepts that can explain aspects of social interaction and of subject-matter information content in cognition and learning. The approach I take, which I call situative, takes activity systems as the main focus of study and analysis, and attempts to understand processes in which participants construct information in common ground that they deem relevant to their progress on the task they are working on. I argue that this situative perspective and the individual information-processing perspective both are valid in a way that encourages development of integration between them. I cite previous research that shows that positioning in the participant framework is an important factor for explaining productive and not-so-productive cognitive phenomena. The analysis of FastPlant data that I present shows, further, that positioning of students can differ in different phases of activity in a task. Specifically, students' agency can differ between activities that generate alternatives to be considered and activities that determine which alternative will be favored.},

  abstract = {College students (in Experiment 1) and 7th-grade students (in Experiment 2) learned how to design the roots, stem, and leaves of plants to survive in 8 different environments through a computer-based multimedia lesson. They learned by interacting with an animated pedagogical agent who spoke to them (Group PA) or received identical graphics and explanations as on-screen text without a pedagogical agent (Group No PA). Group PA outperformed Group No PA on transfer tests and interest ratings but not on retention tests. To investigate further the basis for this personal agent effect, we varied the interactivity of the agent-based lesson (Experiment 3) and found an interactivity effect: Students who participate in the design of plant parts remember more and transfer what they have learned to solve new problems better than students who learn the same materials without participation. Next, we varied whether the agent's words were presented as speech or on-screen text, and whether the agent's image appeared on the screen. Both with a fictional agent (Experiment 4) and a video of a human face (Experiment 5), students performed better on tests of retention and problem-solving transfer when words were presented as speech rather than on-screen text (producing a modality effect) but visual presence of the agent did not affect test performance (producing no image effect). Results support the introduction of interactive pedagogical agents who communicate with students via speech to promote meaningful learning in multimedia lessons. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {Two studies examined how examples and their explanations affect learning to program recursive functions. The results are analyzed in the context of a production system model of analogical problem solving, cognitive skill acquisition, and practice. In Experiment 1, subjects received an example of a recursive function, were trained to criterion on one set of recursive functions, and were tested on transfer to a larger set of recursive functions. The structure of the example solution (how it was written) was explained to one group of subjects, whereas the process generated by the example (how it worked) was explained to another group. The explanation of structure was found to reduce training time when compared with the explanation of process. In Experiment 2, subjects were presented with examples that shared many parts of their solutions with training problems (high-similarity examples) or shared few parts with training problems (low-similarity examples). Examples reduced errors on the first opportunity for acquiring a skill but did not affect subsequent rates of improvement. Increases in overall similarity between example and target solutions (a) reduced learning errors on parts of target solution not analogous to the example, (b) did not reduce errors on parts of the target solution analogous to the example, and (c) did not increase rates of erroneous intrusions from the example. Examples appear to facilitate the initial acquisition of cognitive skills, have no interaction with the strengthening of skills, and facilitate weak-method problem solving that does not involve direct analogies from the examples.},

In Experiment 1, an epistemological questionnaire was administered to undergraduates. Factor analysis of the questionnaire resulted in 4 factors reflecting degrees of belief in innate ability, simple knowledge, quick learning, and certain knowledge. In Experiment 2, students read a passage about either the social sciences or the physical sciences, in which the concluding paragraph was removed. Then they related their confidence in understanding the passage, wrote a conclusion, and completed a mastery test. Belief in quick learning predicted oversimplified conclusions, poor performance on the mastery test, and overconfidence in test performance. Belief in certain knowledge predicted inappropriately absolute conclusions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Software design involves translating a set of task requirements into a structured description of a computer program that will perform the task. A software designer can use design schema, collaborative design knowledge, or can reuse design artifacts. Very little has been done to include reuse of design artifacts in the software development life cycle, despite tremendous promises of reuse. As a result, this technique has not seen widespread use, possibly due to a lack of cognitive understanding of the reuse process. This research explores the role of a specific cognitive aspect, opportunism, in demand-side software reuse. We propose a cognitive model based on opportunism that describes the software design process with reuse. Protocol analysis verifies that the software design with reuse is indeed opportunistic and reveals that some software designers employ certain tasks of the reuse process frequently. Based on these findings, we propose a reuse support system that incorporates blackboard technology and existing reuse library management system},

One possible reason for this is that novices hold `non-viable' mental models (internal explanations of how something works) of key programming concepts which then cause misconceptions and difficulties. An initial study investigated the apparent viability of novices' models of fundamental programming concepts, focusing on value and reference assignment. This revealed that many students appeared to hold `non-viable' mental models of these key concepts and that those students who appeared to hold viable mental models performed significantly better in programming tasks than those with non-viable models. To address this, a teaching model integrating cognitive conflict and program visualisation is proposed. A series of studies found that this teaching model is potentially effective in enhancing engagement with learning materials and may therefore help novice programmers develop a better understanding of key concepts.},

Such appeals to authority are at odds with the values and practices within the disciplines of science. There has been significant amount of attention to this mismatch in the science education research literature, primarily with respect to experimentation and argumentation as core disciplinary means of assessing ideas. In this article, we call attention to another aspect of scientific reasoning: a focus on causal mechanisms in explaining natural phenomena. We highlight examples and research from the history and philosophy of science to clarify what scientists mean by ldquomechanismrdquo and to make the case for its centrality. We then present an excerpt from a second-grade class in which a student provides an incorrect mechanistic explanation, and the teacher gives priority to textbook correctness. As the conversation proceeds, the student shifts from mechanistic sensemaking to quoting terminology she does not understand. We argue that attention to mechanism in the classroom would better support student reasoning and better reflect disciplinary epistemology. \dbend{} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed 1-17, 2008},

  abstract = {In most work investigating factors influencing the success of analogies in instruction, an underlying assumption is that students have little or no knowledge of the target situation (the situation to be explained by analogy). It is interesting to ask what influences the success of analogies when students believe they understand the target situation. If this understanding is not normative, instruction must aim at conceptual change rather than simply conceptual growth. Through the analysis of four case studies of tutoring interviews (two of which achieved some noticeable conceptual change and two of which did not) we propose a preliminary list of factors important for success in overcoming misconceptions via analogical reasoning. First, there must be a usable anchoring conception. Second, the analogical connection between an anchoring example and the target situation may need to be developed explicitly through processes such as the use of intermediate, ``bridging'' analogies. Third, it may be necessary to engage the student in a process of analogical reasoning in an interactive teaching environment, rather than simply presenting the analogy in tetext or lecture. Finally, the result of this process may need to be more than analogical transfer of abstract relational structure. The analogies may need to be used to enrich the target situation, leading to the student's construction of a new explanatory model.},

  abstract = {The role that students' knowledge about the nature of science plays in their daily learning of science in school is not well understood. To explore this topic, two categories are introduced that classify how students' understanding of the nature of science has been operationalized. Distal knowledge of the nature of science is students' declarative knowledge about professional science, including about the nature of scientific knowledge and scientists' epistemological commitments. Proximal knowledge of the nature of science is students' personal understandings, beliefs, and commitments regarding their own science learning and the scientific knowledge they\dbend-\dbend{}not scientists\dbend-\dbend{}produce and encounter. It is suggested that viewing these two kinds of knowledge structures within modern information processing frameworks that delineate roles of epistemological and metacognitive knowledge in learning can guide future research on students' knowledge about the nature of science as a mediator, not just an outcome, of their science experiences in school. \dbend{} 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

Worries include double-grading for correctness of both source and test code and finding time to teach testing as a topic.

According to most existing studies, TDD improves software quality and student productivity. This paper surveys the current state of TDD experiments conducted exclusively at universities. Similar surveys compare experiments in both the classroom and industry, but none have focused strictly on academia.},

Third, we observed that students' language on concept questions evolves with repeated testing, becoming more conceptually accurate but technically less precise.

The equations were of the type employed when students are first introduced to chemical equation balancing in high school. All students were able to successfully balance the four equations presented to them. However, seven of the twelve students were not able to construct diagrams that were reasonably consistent with the notation of the balanced equation. It was further noted that these same students possessed very poor understanding of the concept of chemical subscript and were willing to violate the balancing rule which states that subscripts are not to be changed while balancing equations. The five students who were able to make consistent diagrams also possessed good concepts of subscript and the balancing rule.},

  abstract = {Abstract  This article articulates how a `grasp of practice' serves as a reasoning resource for inquiry and citizenship abilities associated
with nature of science (NOS) understanding. Theoretically, this resource is elaborated through an overlapping concern with
`practice' in two literatures, science studies and psychology of learning, bringing attention to two key roles in scientific
practice, Critiquers and Constructors of claims. Empirically, this resource is made plausible by the results of an expert-novice
study and a classroom study. In the expert-novice study, reactions of scientists and laypeople to science-related claims in
the popular media were contrasted, underlining the appropriate ways scientists tend to Critique such claims. In the classroom
study, sixth-grade students engaged in a 2-week ramp experiment, experiencing first hand the roles of Critiquers and Constructors
of claims, and were subsequently assessed with a novel experimental task. Performances suggest that students had attained
a grasp of practice, going well beyond mere execution of methods or procedures. These results challenge a common assumption
that declarative knowledge best characterizes learning targets for supporting inquiry and NOS understanding.},

  abstract = {The motivation for this article is our belief that theory is critically important but currently underplayed in design research studies. We seek to characterize and illustrate a genre of theorizing that seems to us strongly synergistic with design-based research. We begin by drawing contrasts with kinds of theory that are relevant but, we contend, by themselves inadequate. A central element of the type of productive design-based theorizing on which we focus is "ontological innovation," hypothesizing and developing explanatory constructs, new categories of things in the world that help explain how it works. A key criterion to which we adhere when discussing ontological innovations is that theory must do real design work in generating, selecting and validating design alternatives at the level at which they are consequential for learning. Developing and refining an ontological innovation is challenging and requires the kind of extensive, iterative work that characterizes design experiments more generally. However, the pay-off in terms of clarity of focus and explanatory power can be great. We present two case studies that illustrate the development, refinement, extension, and instructional application of ontological innovations.},

  shorttitle = {Introduction},
  abstract = {For many years, chemical education research was done by individuals involved in pre-service teacher training and in-service teacher workshops. As a result, it often focused on the problems faced by elementary- and secondary-school students encountering chemistry topics for the first time. Because a large fraction of the students enrolled in chemistry courses at the tertiary level can be found in first-year courses, it is not surprising that as research expanded to studies of college and university students, it began by looking at the experiences of students in introductory courses. Recent years have seen a significant increase in the number of research studies that focus on students in upper-level courses at the undergraduate and graduate level. This is an important development because of the different cognitive and pedagogical challenges that are encountered in 'advanced' courses. This special issue of CERP is therefore devoted to studies that have the potential of producing changes in the way upper-level courses are taught that are equivalent to the changes that research on the teaching and learning of chemistry by high-school and introductory level students has had on the way courses for these students are being taught.},

  lccn = {62286544},
  abstract = {Background As presented by Willet and Singer (1991), survival analysis can sensitively reveal rich information about when students leave their majors. Although survival analysis has been used to investigate student and faculty retention, it has not been applied to undergraduate engineering student retention. Purpose (Hypothesis) The impact of cohort, gender, ethnicity, and SAT math and verbal scores on the loss rate of undergraduate engineering students was investigated to answer the questions: Does the profile of risk of dropout differ among groups with different backgrounds? When are students most likely to leave engineering? Which SAT scores better predict the risk of dropout? Design/Method Using a large longitudinal database that includes 100,179 engineering students from nine universities and spans 19 years, nonparametric survival analysis was adopted to obtain nonparametric estimates of survival and associated hazard functions, and complete rank tests for the association of variables. Results There are significant differences for early semesters: White or female students tend to leave engineering earlier than other populations. Engineering students leave engineering during the third semester the most, although students who have an SAT math score less than 550 tend to leave engineering during the second semester. SAT math score better predicts the risk of dropout than SAT verbal score. Conclusions The results of this study support using survival analysis to better understand factors that determine student success since student retention is a dynamic problem. Survival analysis allows characteristics such as risk to be evaluated by semester, giving insight to when interventions might be most effective. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

The latter group of studies has generally focused on differences in epistemological beliefs for students who are studying in two different domains (e.g., nursing students versus physics students). In this study, we qualitatively investigate whether the epistemological perspectives of 60 science/engineering college students differs across the disciplinary areas of the sciences and the humanities. Our results indicate that such differences do exist and include a proposed grounded theory that describes how students' epistemologies may vary across knowledge domains.},

We describe the design of the material needed to produce the animations: (1) identifying an instructional situation, (2) identifying norms of the contract that are key in that situation, (3) selecting or creating a scenario that illustrates those norms, (4) proposing alternative scenarios that instantiate breaches of those norms, and (5) anticipating justifications or rebuttals for the breaches that could be found in instructors' reactions.

  doi = {10.1002/sce.20262},
  abstract = {Previous research has indicated that the use of multiple representations with macroscopic and molecular features can improve conceptual understanding; however, the influence of prior knowledge of the domain cannot be overlooked. Using eye-tracking technology and sequential analysis, this study investigated how high school students (n = 54) with different levels of prior knowledge transitioned among the macroscopic and molecular representations of the selected cell transport graphics. The results indicated that high prior knowledge students transitioned more frequently between the molecular representations, whereas low prior knowledge students transitioned more frequently between the macroscopic representations. These findings suggest that students with high prior knowledge distributed their visual attention on conceptually relevant features, whereas low prior knowledge students focused on surface features. In addition, low prior knowledge students transitioned more frequently between macroscopic and molecular representations, suggesting that these students were experiencing more difficulty as they were coordinating the representations. Because these students were using surface features to create linkages between the representations, they were unable to understand the underlying themes. More research on the differences in the distribution of visual attention among learners can provide further insight as to the difficulties low prior knowledge students face when interpreting multiple representations. \dbend{} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {This paper reports on two experiments comparing mental representations and program comprehension by novices in the object-oriented and procedural styles. The subjects were novice programmers enrolled in a second course in programming which taught either the object-oriented or the procedural paradigm. The first experiment compared the mental representations and comprehension of short programs written in the procedural and object-oriented styles. The second experiment extended the study to a larger program incorporating more advanced language features. For the short programs there was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to the total number of questions answered correctly, but the object-oriented subjects were superior to the procedural subjects at answering questions about program function. This suggests that function information was more readily available in their mental representations of the programs and supports an argument that the object-oriented notation highlights function at the level of the individual class. For the long program a corresponding effect was not found. The comprehension of procedural subjects was superior to object-oriented subjects on all types of question. The difficulties experienced by the object-oriented subjects in answering questions in a larger program suggest that they faced problems in marshaling information and drawing inferences from it. We suggest that this result may be related to a longer learning curve for novices of the object-oriented style, as well as to features of the OO style and the particular OO language notation.},

The authors introduce and explore the work of ``making practice studyable'' by analyzing a case of practice-based professional development in which the professional development designers deliberately tried to mediate participants' learning in and from practice. From this analysis, the authors identified five categories of work that can help make practice studyable: (1) engaging the content, (2) providing insight into student thinking, (3) orienting to the instructional context, (4) providing lenses for viewing, and (5) developing a disposition of inquiry. These categories are then applied to the use of a representation of mathematics teaching in a course for preservice elementary teachers.},

Based on extensive ethnographic observation, video recordings, interviews with participants and observers, and children's design artifacts and engineering logbooks, fourth- and fifth-grade students' designing activities were interpreted from the perspective of situated cognition. The results show that children's designing was related to the artifacts, tools, materials, teacher-set constraints, and current trends in the setting. However, these elements cannot be taken as having some absolute ontology but are interpretively flexible. In the course of the engineering unit, the fourth- and fifth-grade students learned to exploit this interpretive flexibility to frame and solve problems. The emerging artifacts had at least two important functions: They were resources that structured the design process by both opening up possibilities and providing constraints, and they served to coordinate discursive and practical actions. The findings have important implications for affordances and constraints of learning environments in which designing is both a goal and a vehicle of instruction and for the evaluation of students' activities in such settings.},

  abstract = {This paper develops personalized models for different university degrees to obtain the risk of each student abandoning his degree and analyzes the profile for undergraduates that abandon the degree. In this study three faculties located in Granada, South of Spain, were involved. In Software Engineering three university degrees with 10,844 students, in humanities nineteen university degrees with 39,241 students and in Economic Sciences five university degrees with 25,745 students were considered. Data, corresponding to the period 1992 onwards, are used to obtain a model of logistic regression for each faculty which represents them satisfactorily. These models and the framework data show that certain variables appear repeatedly in the explanation of the drop out in all of the faculties. These variables are, among others, start age, the father's and mother's studies, academic performance, success, average mark in the degree and the access form and in some cases also, the number of rounds needed to pass. Students with weak educational strategies and without persistence to achieve their aims in life have low academic performance and low success rates and this implies a high risk of abandoning the degree. The results suggest that each university centre could consider similar models to elaborate a particular action plan to help lower the drop out rate reducing costs and efforts. As concluded in this paper, the profile of the students who tend to abandon their studies is dependent on the subject studied. For this reason, a general methodology based on a Data Warehouse architecture is proposed. This architecture does most of the work automatically and is general enough to be used at any university centre because it only takes into account the usual data the students provide when registered in a course and their grades throughout the years.},

Our data, collected on three occasions over the year, indicate that for the empirical justifications, the subjects considered personal conviction and public validation to be distinct attributes, judged by different criteria, whereas for the deductive justification, there was little evidence of any perceived distinction. Understanding of what constitutes an empirical proof improved significantly between the first and second run of the experiment, and a tendency to accept a deductive argument as a proof (whether or not it was) increased over time.},

Our central contention is that programming can offer a key to resolving the tension between the different representational structures of narrative and mathematical formalism. In the course of describing our approach, we make a distinction between the epistemic-cognitive elements of narrative and the social, cultural and affective elements. We then elaborate the theoretical grounds of the individual epistemic facets of narrative. We propose a link between narrative theories of learning and constructionist traditions, specifically the notion of situated abstraction. This link suggests the possibility of further dialogue between the two academic communities.},

As part of our project, we are engaging in an analysis of the nature of MRC, and we have begun to explore instructional implications. This introductory paper provides an overview of that work, including its goals and results, and it also provides an introduction to the four following papers in the issue.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the pedagogical impact of real-world experimental projects undertaken as part of an advanced undergraduate fluid mechanics subject at an Australian university. The projects have been organized to complement traditional lectures and introduce students to the challenges of professional design, physical modelling, data collection and analysis. An overview of two projects is presented: wind tunnel testing of buildings and wave loading on piles. Both studies are undertaken as group work within the undergraduate subject. The pedagogy of the projects is discussed in terms of the classical educational psychology literature concerning project-based learning, collaborative and guided learning and reflection. In terms of learning outcomes, the primary aim is to enable students to deliver a professional report as the final product, where physical model data are compared to ideal-fluid flow calculations and real-fluid flow analyses. Thus the students are exposed to a professional design approach involving a high level of expertise in fluid mechanics, with sufficient academic guidance to achieve carefully defined learning goals, while retaining sufficient flexibility for students to construct their own learning goals. The overall pedagogy is a blend of problem-based and project-based learning, which reflects academic research and professional practice. The assessment is a mix of peer-assessed oral presentations and written reports that aims to maximize student reflection and development. Student feedback indicated a strong motivation for courses that include a well-designed project component. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

It was argued that these twinned sets of ideas may define critical moments of irreversible conceptual transformation in the educational experiences of learners, and their teachers. The present study aims (a) to examine the extent to which such phenomena can be located within personal understandings of discipline-specific epistemological discourses, (b) to develop more extensively notions of liminality within learning that were raised in the first paper, and (c) to propose a conceptual framework within which teachers may advance their own reflective practice.},

The analysis shows that the use of empirical generalizations as intellectual tools in strategic planning and the lack of firsthand observational and experiential data about the clients' problems hampered the management team's attempt to find a new strategy to avoid a future crisis for the business.},

  abstract = {Theories of mind are implicitly embedded in educational research. The predominant theory of mind during the latter half of the twentieth century has focused primarily on the individual mind in isolation, context-free problem-solving and mental representations and reasoning, what we refer to as cognitivism. Over the last two decades, CS Education researchers have begun to incorporate recent research that extends, elaborates and sometimes challenges cognitivism. These theories, which we refer to collectively as sociocultural cognition theory, view minds as cultural products, biologically evolved to be extended by tools, social interaction and embodied interaction in the world. Learning, under this perspective, is viewed as tool-mediated participation in the ongoing practices of cultural communities. In this paper, we pursue three goals. First, we provide a summary of the key principles in sociocultural cognition theory, placing this theory within a historical context with respect to the cognitive theories that it extends and challenges. Second, we integrate across different but related research efforts that all fall under the sociocultural cognition umbrella, using a uniform terminology for describing ideas represented within different discourse communities. And third, we reference a number of canonical sources in sociocultural cognition theory so as to serve as an index into this diverse literature for those wanting to explore further.},

  abstract = {The theoretical perspective outlined here offers an alternative to explanations of knowledge transfer that posit its source in the construction and application of abstract, context-independent knowledge structures. A case study analysis of an undergraduate student's attempt to solve a series of problems related to an elementary statistical principle revealed how she came to see problems initially thought to be different as alike, as she slowly came to identify different problems as instances of a single principle. Microgenetic analysis of the data supports diSessa's (1993) knowledge-in-pieces epistemology, which suggests that complex conceptual understanding is supported by the systematization of many different types of knowledge resources, often highly sensitive to context. A "transfer-in-pieces" approach demonstrates how means of attending to (reading out) and coordinating information available in particular instances may vary as a single mathematical principle is perceived as relevant in different contextual circumstances. Transfer is revealed not as rooted in the acquisition of increasingly abstract mental representations, but through the incremental refinement of knowledge resources that account for\textemdash{}rather than overlook\textemdash{}contextual variation.

  abstract = {$<$p$>$$<$br/$>$Hierarchical graphs represent relationships between objects (like computer file systems, family trees etc.). Graph nodes represent the objects and interconnecting lines represent the relationships. In two experiments we investigated what concepts are necessary for understanding hierarchical graphs, what misconceptions evolve when some of the concepts are missing and how misconceptions can be prevented through instruction. Participants were taught different amounts of prior knowledge and then had to respond to a multiple-choice questionnaire with interpretive questions about graphs. In Experiment 1, 72 university students received different amounts of instruction about the concepts necessary to interpret hierarchical graphs. Through detailed analysis of readers' wrong responses to interpretive questions we identified a set of misconceptions. Participants maintained fewer misconceptions and performed better if they had been taught more conceptual knowledge. However, their overall performance was poor. In Experiment 2, 85 students were informed about possible misconceptions, in addition to the instruction of conceptual knowledge. With this intervention they obtained an acceptable level of understanding of hierarchical graphs. The discussion of the results draws on theoretical considerations for the evolvement of misconceptions such as failure to integrate visual and conceptual information and context specificity of the representation.$<$/p$>$},

  abstract = {Various publications over the past several years have discussed the cognitive benefits of learning the programming language LOGO. This study represents an effort to experimentally evaluate the claims that learning LOGO can enhance children's general thinking skills. Two main points are made. The first is that much of the previous literature investigating the effects of LOGO is flawed due to failure to consider important methodological requirements. The importance of clearly defining training conditions, documenting programming mastery, and defining transfer measures (including underlying theoretical motivations and instrument reliabilities) is discussed, along with the consequences of failure to consider these issues. The second major point deals with the importance of considering the method of teaching LOGO and its effects on the development and transfer of general thinking skills from the LOGO environment to non-LOGO problems. A study attempting to meet the methodological concerns was designed to determine whether a structured teaching method was more effective than an unstructured, discovery-oriented method in achieving language mastery and transfer of general skills. Three groups of fifth graders (structured, unstructured, and control) varying in previous academic success level (successful or less successful) were included. The structured and unstructured groups were taught LOGO for 1 hr per day, 5 days per week, for 5 weeks. Measures of LOGO mastery showed significant differences favoring the structured group on items requiring anything more than basic knowledge of LOGO commands. Pretest and posttest measures of general thinking skills showed no differences between experimental and control students on tests of students' independent performance, although one test measuring performance in a prompted testing situation showed significant differences favoring the experimental group. Implications of these results for teaching general thinking skills are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {The article briefly explores the concept of the self in terms of the difference between anthropologist Margaret Mead and author Herbert Blumer, on the one hand, and philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce and author Norbert Wiley, on the other. Mead and Blumer contribute to standard symbolic interactionism, while Peirce and Wiley contribute to semiotic interpretivism. There are hints of Peirce's triadic view in Mead's writings, which is not surprising. Mead was associated with the Pragmatist movement in the U.S. and the well-known pragmatists benefited from Peirce's insights. Without necessarily accepting all of Peirce's complex architectonic system, the author says that a very useful insight in Peirce's semiotics can be find. In Mead's social behaviorist model there is something between the stimulus and the response and that is the significant symbol. For Peirce, it is possible to expand on the more specific notion of a significant symbol and include all signs. The usefulness of a triadic system of representation of the relationship between interpretants and representants does not take away from the value of Mead's contribution to sociology.},

This paper focuses on teachers and teaching in the development of fruitful learning experiences for students with mathematics. It recognises primarily that teachers are humans with personal characteristics, subject to a range of influences through the communities of which they are a part, and considers aspects of teachers' personhood, identity and agency in designing teaching for the benefit of their students. Teaching is seen as a developmental process in which inquiry plays a central role, both in doing mathematics in the classroom and in exploring teaching practice. The teacher-as-inquirer in collaboration with outsider researchers leads to growth of knowledge in teaching through development of identity and agency for both groups. The inclusion of the outsider researcher brings an additional node into the didactic triangle.},

I offer a pointer toward possible development in that direction. Doug Macbeth's commentary presents a fundamental challenge to the program that I am trying to contribute to. Macbeth challenges the aim of explanatory hypotheses. In response, I discuss recent development of a concept of mechanistic explanation in philosophy of science, which I believe is consistent with the accounts of activity that I have proposed as well as with those provided in ethnomethodology, including Macbeth's accounts here. Kay McClain's commentary correctly argues that my paper neglected important functions of teachers in determining the agenda for their classrooms. I am grateful for McClain's suggestion that the theoretical frame that I have been working to develop could provide a contribution to the field of teacher development. Allan Collins's commentary discusses representational and metarepresentational competence, including an important issue of designing activities in which students develop both technical capabilities for representational practices and positive intellective identities.},

In this article, we examine the use of submicroscopic and symbolic representations in chemical explanations and ascertain how they provide meaning. Of specific interest is the development of students' levels of understanding, conceived as instrumental (knowing how) and relational (knowing why) understanding, as a result of regular Grade 11 chemistry lessons using analogical, anthropomorphic, relational, problem-based, and model-based explanations. Examples of both teachers' and students' dialogue are used to illustrate how submicroscopic and symbolic representations are manifested in their explanations of observed chemical phenomena. The data in this research indicated that effective learning at a relational level of understanding requires simultaneous use of submicroscopic and symbolic representations in chemical explanations. Representations are used to help the learner learn; however, the research findings showed that students do not always understand the role of the representation that is assumed by the teacher.},

Primarily, I found it to be essential, particularly at the course's beginning, to embed textbook examples in credible scientific or business contexts in order to try to convince students of the value of statistical experimental design and analysis in their subsequent careers. In contrast, uninteresting, even nonsensical, undeveloped examples that serve only as formula drill give students the opposite impression. My purpose in this article is to present selected expanded textbook examples and to use these illustrations to examine fundamental issues in experimental design such as: the importance of subject-matter, the choice of experimental units, the nature and purpose of blocking, and the contrast between random sampling and random assignment of treatments. These examples expose fundamental issues in how our profession functions in a collaborative environment and how we prepare the next generation of statisticians and statistically savvy professionals.

  abstract = {Currently, considerable debate focuses on whether mind is located in the head or in the individual-in-social-action, and whether development is cognitive self-organization or enculturation into established practices. In this article, I question assumptions that initiate this apparent forced choice between constructivist and sociocultural perspectives. I contend that the two perspectives are complementary. Also, claims that either perspective captures the essence of people and communities should be rejected for pragmatic justifications that consider the contextual relevance and usefulness of a perspective. I argue that the sociocultural perspective informs theories of the conditions for the possibility of learning, whereas theories developed from the constructivist perspective focus on what students learn and the processes by which they do so.},

I discuss each of these points and further develop my position by outlining Putnam's (1987) pragmatic realism, clarifying why Rorty's (1979) work might be of interest to mathematics educators, and revisiting Bereiter's (1985) learning paradox. I then conclude by exploring the relationship between the resulting nondualist approach and John Dewey's philosophy and pedagogy.},

  abstract = {This article considers the nature of complexity and design, as well as relationships between the two, and suggests that design may have much potential as an approach to improving human performance in situations seen as complex. It is developed against two backgrounds. The first is a world view that derives from second order cybernetics and radical constructivism. What is particular about this view is that it accepts that our understanding of the world is made by us, regardless of whether it originates in an external reality or not. Indeed, it regards the question of whether an external reality can ever be known by us as essentially undecidable, which is part of its power. In terms of complexity, this leads to the position that we choose the complexity we see in the world. The second is design. Design is a way of behaving that approaches complexity in a different way (and expecting a different type of outcome) than we have conventionally used. Designers work in a way (a conversation with the self via the medium of drawing) that allows them to deal with very complex, ill-defined and ambiguous situations that would probably be inaccessible using conventional approaches. The outcomes of design are generally novel but can never be argued to be the best solution. Design is necessarily a constructivist, second order cybernetic activity. It is suggested that, as second order cybernetics and radical constructivism give us new insights into the nature of complexity, design gives us a way of acting that comprehends these insights.},

  abstract = {This article discusses the role of context problems, as they are used in the Dutch approach that is known as realistic mathematics education (RME). In RME, context problems are intended for supporting a reinvention process that enables students to come to grips with formal mathematics. This approach is primarily described from an instructional-design perspective. The instructional designer tries to construe a route by which the conventional mathematics can be reinvented. Such a reinvention route will be paved with context problems that offer the students opportunities for progressive mathematizing. Context problems are defined as problems of which the problem situation is experientially real to the student. An RME design for a calculus course is taken as an example, to illustrate that the theory based on the design heuristic using context problems and modeling, which was developed for primary school mathematics, also fits an advanced topic such as calculus. Special attention is given to the RME heuristic that refer to the role models can play in a shift from a model of situated activity to a model for mathematical reasoning. In light of this model-of/model-for shift, it is argued that discrete functions and their graphs play a key role as an intermediary between the context problems that have to be solved and the formal calculus that is developed.},

To do so, we advance the notion of focusing phenomena, that is, regularities in the ways in which teachers, students, artifacts, and curricular materials act together to direct attention toward certain mathematical properties over others. The construct of focusing phenomena emerged from an empirical study conducted during a 5-week unit on slope and linear functions in a high school classroom using a reform curriculum. Qualitative evidence from interviews with 7 students revealed that students interpreted the m value in y = b + mx as a difference rather than a ratio as a result of counterproductive generalization afforded by focusing phenomena. Classroom analysis revealed 4 focusing phenomena, which regularly directed students' attention to various sets of differences rather than to the coordination of quantities.},

  shorttitle = {Constructing {{Professional Portfolios}}},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND While previously researching the educational impacts of single-course and cross-curricular portfolios, investigators noted that student participants described their portfolio activities as positively impacting their growing identities as engineering professionals. These impacts were seen particularly in studies regarding cross-curricular portfolios. PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS) This study was designed to explicitly investigate identity-related impacts of cross-curricular portfolios and to explore the processes students employed during portfolio construction to identify themselves as budding engineers and as future professionals. DESIGN/METHOD Engineering undergraduate students attended four weekly workshops where they wrote a professional statement, selected artifacts that demonstrated their engineering abilities, and wrote annotations that explained how the artifacts served as concrete examples of their claims for professional standing. Online surveys were administered at each workshop asking participants about their ongoing experiences of creating their portfolios and sharing these portfolios with their peers. RESULTS Analysis of the survey responses revealed that participants had two primary frames of reference for the construction of professional identity during portfolio creation. The external frame of reference focused on students' understanding of the expectations of potential employers and recruiters. The internal frame of reference, which accounted for twice as many responses as the external frame coding, focused on students' emerging realizations of their own values and interests as professional engineers. CONCLUSIONS As engineering educators, we often support the external frame of reference in terms of building professional identity. We need to provide students with opportunities to engage the internal frame of reference with which our participants were particularly concerned. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

  abstract = {This paper explores the research perspective of neuroscience by documenting the brain cell (neuron) drawings of undergraduates, trainee scientists, and leading neuroscience researchers in a single research-intensive university. Qualitative analysis, drawing-sorting exercises, and hierarchical cluster analysis are used to answer two related questions: Are there categorical differences in drawings of participants; and if differences exist, can they be objectively recognized as measures of research experience? The analysis strongly suggests that (1) a willingness/ability to hybridize extant brain cell knowledge with imaginative conjecture grounded by experience of experimental plausibility gives rise to drawings that are recognized as being ``expert signatures'' by all classes of participants; (2) the drawings of PhD students and postdoctoral researchers' are influenced by a more mechanical observation style where faithfulness to actual observation work is prioritized; and (3) while a subset of undergraduates recognize the images of ``experts,'' their own drawings are invariably textbook reproductions. Nevertheless, teaching interventions designed to engender a research perspective free-up undergraduates' creative drawing potential so that sometimes their postintervention drawings are indistinguishable from those of principal investigators. We explore the teaching implications of our data, emphasizing the distinctive role of the principal investigator who is able to index an otherwise invisible process of experimental knowledge making. \textcopyright{} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Two hundred sixty-eight students were sampled from undergraduate mathematics and statistics courses. Students completed inventories reflecting their epistemic profiles and learning strategies, and were profiled as rational, empirical, or both. Based on their profiles, 24 students participated in two problem-solving sessions. Episodes were coded for planning, monitoring, control, use of empirical and rational argumentation, and justification for solutions. For both self-reported metacognitive self-regulation and regulation of cognition during problem solving, students profiled as rational had the highest self-reported mean and actual frequency of regulation of cognition compared to students profiled as predominantly empirical. Moreover, students profiled as predominantly rational correctly solved more problems than the other two groups. Finally, students' approaches to problem solving were consistent with their epistemic profiles. Relations are discussed in the context of various theoretical frameworks.},

The methodology utilizes basic statistical techniques to identify significant differences between STEM and non-STEM students within seven population subgroups based upon school attended, race/ethnicity, and gender. The value of individual variables is assessed by how consistently significant differences are found across the subgroups. The variables found to be most valuable in identifying STEM students reflect both quantitative and qualitative measures. Quantitative measures of academic ability such as SAT mathematics score, high school grade point average, and to a lesser extent SAT verbal score are all indicators. Qualitative measures including self-ratings of mathematical ability, computer skills, and academic ability are also good indicators. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

This framework is used to describe the videotaped behaviors of 27 seventh-grade students of varying ability working in small groups to solve a mathematical problem. The results suggest the importance of metacognitive processes in mathematical problem solving in a small-group setting. A continuous interplay of cognitive and metacognitive behaviors appears to be necessary for successful problem solving and maximum student involvement. Within the groups, students returned several times to such problem-solving episodes as reading, understanding, exploring, analyzing, planning, implementing, and verifying. Stimulated-recall interviews held after completion of the task underscored an additional dimension of importance. Attitudes, particularly those of high-ability students, seemed to affect the interactions and the problem-solving behaviors of fellow group members. The framework shows promise of being a powerful tool for the future study of mathematical problem solving in a small-group setting.},

We apply human-factors research methods to explore the effectiveness of these messages. Unlike existing work in this area, we study messages at a fine-grained level by analyzing the edits students make in response to various classes of errors. We present a rubric (which is not language specific) to evaluate student responses, apply it to a course-worth of student lab work, and describe what we have learned about using the rubric effectively. We also discuss some concrete observations on the effectiveness of these messages.},

Students individually respond to a question, discuss with peers, and respond to the same question again. In general, the peer discussion portion of PI leads to an increase in the number of students answering a question correctly. But are these students really learning, or are they just "copying" the right answer from someone in their group? In an article in the journal Science, Smith et al. affirm that genetics students individually learn from discussion: having discussed a first question with their peers, students are better able to correctly, individually answer a second, conceptually-related question. We replicate their study, finding that students in upper-division computing courses (architecture and theory of computation) also learn from peer discussions, and explore differences between our results and those of Smith et al. Our work reveals that using raw percentage gains between paired questions may not fully illuminate the value of peer discussion. We define a new metric, Weighted Learning Gain, which better reflects the learning value of discussion. By applying this metric to both genetics and computing courses, we consistently find that 85-89\% of "potential learners" benefit from peer discussion.},

This claim is supported by interview data I collected primarily from faculty involved in the development and teaching of interdisciplinary courses in programs including the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Bioethics, Swarthmore College's Interpretation Theory, and the NEXA Program at San Francisco State University. I suggest that interdisciplinary thinking is fundamentally similar to dialogical exchanges occurring in language and in collaborative activities in which epistemological positions are bartered. Bakhtin's (1981) theory of dialogic understanding and subsequent linguistic theories of conceptual metaphor and blending serve as a constructive theoretical framework for the understanding of interdisciplinary cognition. Viewing disciplines broadly as languages, epistemologies, and collaborative practices helps uncover some underlying cognitive mechanisms that deserve further investigation.},

  abstract = {To improve access to algebraic word problems, primary aged students in Singapore are taught to utilise schematic models. Symbolic algebra is not taught until the secondary school years. To examine whether the two methods drew on different cognitive processes and imposed different cognitive demands, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine patterns of brain activation whilst problem solvers were using the two methods. To improve our ability to detect differences attributable to the two methods, rather than participant's abilities to use the two methods, we used adult problem solvers who had high levels of competency in both methods. In a previous study, we focused on the initial stages of problem solving: translating word problems into either schematic or symbolic representations (Lee et al. in Brain Res 1155:163\textendash{}171, 2007 ). In this study, we focused on the later stages of problem solving: in computing numeric solutions from presented schematic or symbolic representations. Participants were asked to solve simple algebraic questions presented in either format. Greater activation in the symbolic method was found in the middle and medial frontal gyri, anterior cingulate, caudate, precuneus, and intraparietal sulcus. Greater activation in the model condition was found largely in the occipital areas. These findings suggest that generating and computing solutions from symbolic representations require greater general cognitive and numeric processing resources than do processes involving model representations. Differences between the two methods appear to be of both a quantitative and qualitative nature.},

Evidence of variability in student epistemologies, however, suggests the need for more complex models. Hammer and Elby (2002) proposed modeling personal epistemologies as comprised of manifold epistemological resources. This difference in ontology--the form research attributes to cognitive structure--accounts for variability: The activation of these epistemological resources depends on context. Our purpose in this article is to argue that it also accounts for coherences in student epistemologies, in particular for multiple local coherences. We advance this argument using a case study of a 15-min discussion by a group of eighth graders about the "rock cycle" (the cyclic transformations of rock among different forms). We begin with evidence of the students' working from a stable, coherent epistemological stance. Then, after a brief, purely epistemological intervention by the teacher, the evidence indicates they are working from a different but also coherent and stable epistemological stance.},

Schommer's (1993) study, in which the development of secondary students' beliefs about the nature of knowledge and learning, or epistemological beliefs, was examined. High school students (N\hspace{0.6em}=\hspace{0.6em}69) completed an epistemological questionnaire as freshmen in 1992 and as seniors in 1995. Repeated-measures analyses revealed that their beliefs in fixed ability to learn, simple knowledge, quick learning, and certain knowledge changed as they neared the end of their 4th year in high school. In addition, the less students believed in quick learning, the better grade point average they earned. These results are consistent with a cross-sectional study (M. Schommer, 1993) establishing substantial differences in students' epistemological beliefs across the high school years and thus strengthen the case that there is development of epistemological beliefs related to learning during high school.

In the last decade there has been an accelerated flow of findings in multiple disciplines supporting a view of affect as complexly intertwined with cognition in guiding rational behaviour, memory retrieval, decision-making, creativity, and more. It is time to redress the imbalance by developing theories and technologies in which affect and cognition are appropriately integrated with one another. This paper describes work in that direction at the MIT Media Lab and projects a large perspective of new research in which computer technology is used to redress the imbalance that was caused (or, at least, accentuated) by the computer itself.},

  abstract = {$<$p$>$$<$br/$>$This paper is part of a series of studies by the Research in Undergraduate Mathematics Education Community (RUMEC), concerning the nature and development of college students' mathematical knowledge. This project began as an attempt to explore calculus students' understanding of the chain rule and its applications. Based on the initial description of how the chain rule concept may be learned (genetic decomposition) an attempt to interpret the data using the Action-Process-Object theoretical framework is made. The insufficiency of this alone led to an extension of the Action-Process-Object-Schema epistemological framework (APOS) which includes a theory of schema development based on ideas of Piaget and Garcia. The Piagetian Triad is suggested as a mechanism for describing schema development in general, and the chain rule is used as an example. The Triad of the Intra, Inter and Trans stages of schema development provides the structure for interpreting the students' understanding of the chain rule and classifying their responses to interview questions about the chain rule. The results of this data analysis allowed for a proposed revised epistemological analysis of the chain rule. Finally, several suggestions and questions for future study are presented.$<$/p$>$},

  issn = {0020-1812},
  doi = {10.1007/s00040-010-0121-2},
  abstract = {Insect workers cooperate to carry out a variety of tasks. One example is cooperative transport of food items by two or more ant workers, which is important in foraging in many species. We predicted that natural selection would result in strategies that improve the performance of this task and tested this in Pheidole oxyops, a Neotropical ant in which ca. 70\% of the biomass of dead insects brought back to the nest is transported cooperatively. We specifically tested the hypothesis that groups would re-orient food items to reduce drag, given that legs, wings, and other projections should affect the ease of dragging prey in different orientations. By presenting ants with artificial food items and dead cockroaches, both of which required approximately twice as much force to drag backwards as forwards, and a control which was equally easy to move in both orientations, we showed that natural groups of 3\textendash{}20 food-transporting ants usually turned items that were facing backwards (72 and 83\% of trials for artificial food items or cockroaches, respectively), the orientation requiring greater force, but not items facing forwards (10 and 12\% of trials, respectively). Turning usually involved a single `steering' ant. The key role of the `steering' ant was shown by removing either the current steering ant or a randomly chosen `non-steering' ant during turning. In 100\% of the trials in which the steering ant was removed, turning stopped until another ant took its place. Conversely, turning stopped in only 17\% of trials in which a `non-steering' ant was removed. Turning is an emergent property of the system and may not have been directly selected for. Rather, turning seems to occur through a combination of pre-existing retrieval behaviour and the underlying physics of large loads. Points where the food item catches the ground can act as a fulcrum or pivot around which the item can rotate. Ants furthest from the fulcrum have more leverage and so are more likely to play a key role in turning. A simple rule relevant to individual transport of food items such as ``grasp the food item and move towards the nest'', when used in the context of cooperative transport, has allowed the ants to solve a seemingly complicated problem requiring coordination.},

Students' expressed ideas did not change over the course of the intervention, suggesting important differences between students' talk during inquiry and their abilities to talk epistemologically about science.

  volume = {19},
  abstract = {Software reuse\textemdash{}the application of existing software artifacts in the development of a new system\textemdash{}has been claimed to dramatically improve systems development productivity and quality. These claims have been particularly pronounced with respect to the reuse of object-oriented (OO) software artifacts. However, the empirical evaluations of these claims are relatively sparse and often inconsistent. This paper begins to address the gap in the literature. A verbal-protocol study was conducted in which analysts created a model for a problem (the target ) and were given an example problem and solution (the source ) to reuse. The results show little support for reuse in OO analysis. First, reuse had no effect on the quality of the OO analysis models. Subjects given a highly reusable example produced solutions that were no better than those of subjects in the control group. Second, the degree of similarity between the source and target problems did have an effect on the reuse process , although it did not impact the reuse outcome . Subjects given the example with the most similarity to the target problem quickly recognized the reuse potential, attempted a fair amount of reuse, but made several errors stemming from lazy copying. Subjects given an example with a lesser (but still significant) degree of similarity were often unable to recognize the reuse potential, and thus engaged in less reuse activity. Thus, the characteristics of the source-target comparison that facilitate noticing the reuse potential of the source do not necessarily help in applying the source solution to the target problem. These results suggest that the claims associated with reuse should be treated with a healthy dose of skepticism.},

  title = {Uncovering Principles of Novice Programming},
  doi = {10.1145/567067.567069},
  abstract = {It is widely known that programming, even at a simple level, is a difficult activity to learn. Why is this so? Are novice difficulties really inherent in programming or are they related, to the nature of the programming tools currently given to novices? To answer this question we have used novice Pascal computer programs collected from their terminal sessions, controlled clinical studies focusing on specific aspects of novice programming techniques, and video-taped interviews of novice programming [Bonar, 1982]. In each we focused on bugs and buggy programs. Bugs and errors illuminate what a novice is actually thinking -- providing us a window on the difficulties as they are experienced by the novice.In previous reports we presented evidence that current programming languages do not accurately reflect the cognitive strategies used by novice programmers [Soloway et al, 1981]. Instead, we have found that novice programmers possess knowledge about and experience with step-by-step specifications in natural language. This knowledge and experience gives them powerful intuitions for using a programming language. Programming languages, however, are, not designed to appeal to these intuitions. On a semantic and pragmatic level, there are incompatibilities between the way, natural and programming languages are used. Many novice programming bugs can be directly traced to an inappropriate use of natural language specification style or strategy.As an example of these incompatibility bugs consider the "while demon" bug. Novices with this bug assume that the actions in the body of the while loop are continuously monitored for the exit condition to become true. This interpretation is consistent with the English language usage of the word while: e.g."while the highway is two lanes, continue, north". In an earlier written study [Soloway et al, 1981] found that 34\% of the students in an introductory programming course thought the test in a Pascal while loop was performed, as a demon. Furthermore, a later interview study showed that novices could even describe the implementation mechanism for such a demon:"\ldots{} everytime I [the variable tested in the while condition] is assigned a new value, the machine needs to check that value \ldots"In this report we describe our use of video-taped interview studies for understanding how novices use a programming system. Interviews provide valuable information not available through statistical analysis of written studies. Written studies allow us to manipulate specific factors and guage the results to performance or style. Furthermore, we can have statistical confidence in those results. An interview study, on the other hand, allows us to examine the source of performance or style differences uncovered. Interviews give us an "execution trace" while written studies give us the final output. We use both kinds of studies, depending on the kind of information needed.We have interviewed seventeen novice programmers. Four were interviewed regularly for the first 8-10 weeks of their introductory programming course. For these regular subjects we have about 15 hours of interviews tracing their learning and maturation through the course.In this report we show an example natural language specification and discuss strategies used in that specification. We then discuss two examples of novice programming difficulties stemming from an inappropriate use of natural language specification strategies. These examples are illustrated with video tape transcripts. We conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of this work.},

Second, that by opposing mathematics in the students' mind to mathematics in the environment, and, in particular, by attempting to argue that the representational theory of mind opens the "learning paradox," Cobb et al. misinterpret Carl Bereiter (1985), confuse ontological and epistemological issues, stumble into the perennial philosophical problem of universals, and indicate that they might be interested in discussing the philosophy of mathematics. Third, that in arguing for a relatively pure, "radical" constructivism, Cobb et al. mistake the pragmatic force of the constructivist argument, confuse matters of value with matters of taste, and attempt to fashion too dogmatic a connection between theory and practice in mathematics education.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the possible connection between effective laboratory activities and student performance on lecture exams. In a traditional undergraduate organic chemistry course for non- science majors, students could predict the products of organic reactions, but struggled to provide reaction mechanisms for those same reactions, despite obtaining perfect scores on their laboratory reports where reaction mechanisms were required. In addition, student attitudes toward chemistry in general were sharply negative after taking organic chemistry. To address these two issues, we implemented POGIL activities in the course and the Science Writing Heuristic in the laboratory to replace the standard lecture format and verification laboratory experiments. This paper will focus on student performance on nucleophilic substitution reaction mechanisms on a class exam. Performance on these questions improved compared with students in past traditional classes. In addition, students were given a pre-class and post-class survey regarding their perceptions of the course. At the conclusion of the term, many students thought the class was easier than what they initially expected. This illustrates the view that non-science majors have the ability to learn organic chemistry from a mechanistic point of view, and integrate concepts learned in the laboratory with concepts presented in the lecture.},

In a 2\hspace{0.6em}\texttimes\hspace{0.6em}2 design, we orthogonally varied dimensionality of objects and type of task. Both factors affected reaction times. Type of task was the primary determiner of estimated rate of mental rotation, which was about three times higher for the single-stimulus task. Dimensionality primarily affected an additive component of all reaction times, suggesting that more initial encoding is required for three-dimensional shapes. In the absence of a satisfactory way of controlling stimulus complexity, the results are at least consistent with the proposal that once three-dimensional objects have been encoded, their rotation can be imagined as rapidly as the rotation of two-dimensional shapes.

  abstract = {How do women and men student engineers develop an engineering identity 
(a sense of belonging, or not), while practicing "actual" engineering? 
What are the influences of gender, learning and knowledge, relations of 
power, and conceptions of equality on cultural identity development? I 
studied these issues in reform-minded engineering design classes, 
courses organized around teaching students communications, teamwork, and 
practical engineering. Engineering-student cultural identity categories 
revealed a status hierarchy, predicated on meeting "academic" criteria 
for excellence, and the almost total exclusion of women. While working 
as an engineering colleague on five student teams (three first-year and 
two senior) and attending their design classes, I documented how 
cultural identities were made evident and constructed in students' 
practical engineering. Design projects promoted linking academic 
knowledge with real-world situations, sharing responsibilities and 
trusting colleagues, communicating engineering knowledge to technical 
and non-technical members of business communities, and addressing gaps 
in students' knowledge. With a curriculum analysis and survey of 
students' perceptions of the differences between design and conventional 
courses, I embedded the design classes in the wider campus and found 
that: (1) Engineering education conferred prestige, power, and 
well-paying jobs on students who performed "academic" engineering, while 
failing to adequately encourage "actual" engineering practices. 
High-status student engineers were the least likely to perform "actual" 
engineering in design teams. (2) Engineering education advanced an 
ideology that encouraged its practitioners to consider men's privilege 
and women's invisibility normal. By making "acting like men act" the 
standards to which engineering students must conform, women learned to 
put up with oppressive treatment. Women's accepting their own 
mistreatment and hiding their womanhood became a condition of women's 
belonging. (3) Despite all of the pressures to do otherwise, (some) 
teams of students (at all levels) carved out small oases where "actual" 
engineering prevailed and women's participation was robust. 
Students--not faculty, not progressive pedagogy, not "reformed" 
courses--disrupted prevailing norms. However, two women engineering 
students, one on each senior team, performed fabulous "actual" 
engineering, yet neither of them had a job when they graduated--the only 
two senior students on my teams without jobs.},

These were given prior to, and after, the working tests and, therefore, reflected ratings without and with working experience. The posture of the hand, the lower and the upper arm, and the shoulder during text input were evaluated quite differently as a consequence of using the two keyboards. The working posture associated with the conventional keyboard was never assessed positively. The ratings always reached positive values when operating the ergonomic model. The handling of the keyboard and the overall impression were also in favor of the test keyboard as a result of the working tests. Comfort and effort while typing at the keyboards also differed substantially and were in favor of the test keyboard. The same was true for altogether 10 items of the questionnaire, aiming at evaluation of details of the ergonomic keyboard and its overall appearance. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

In this paper, we propose heuristics for empirically determining the scale of the relevant cognitive dynamics. We illustrate these heuristics in two contrasting cases, one in which the evidence supports attributing cognition to a group of students and one in which the evidence supports attributing cognition to an individual.},

More recently the term design research has been applied to this kind of work. In this article, we outline the goals of design research and how it is related to other methodologies.

  abstract = {In the past, design has most often occurred fairly far downstream in the development process and has focused on making new products aesthetically attractive or enhancing brand perception through smart, evocative advertising. Today, as innovation's terrain expands to encompass human-centered processes and services as well as products, companies are asking designers to create ideas rather than to simply dress them up. Brown, the CEO and president of the innovation and design firm IDEO, is a leading proponent of design thinking -- a method of meeting people's needs and desires in a technologically feasible and strategically viable way. In this article he offers several intriguing examples of the discipline at work. One involves a collaboration between frontline employees from health care provider Kaiser Permanente and Brown's firm to reengineer nursing-staff shift changes at four Kaiser hospitals. Close observation of actual shift changes, combined with brainstorming and rapid prototyping, produced new procedures and software that radically streamlined information exchange between shifts. The result was more time for nursing, better-informed patient care, and a happier nursing staff. Another involves the Japanese bicycle components manufacturer Shimano, which worked with IDEO to learn why 90\% of American adults don't ride bikes. The interdisciplinary project team discovered that intimidating retail experiences, the complexity and cost of sophisticated bikes, and the danger of cycling on heavily trafficked roads had overshadowed people's happy memories of childhood biking. So the team created a brand concept -- "Coasting" -- to describe a whole new category of biking and developed new in-store retailing strategies, a public relations campaign to identify safe places to cycle, and a reference design to inspire designers at the companies that went on to manufacture Coasting bikes.

  abstract = {A total of 136 eighth-grade math students from 2 Singapore schools learned from either productive failure (PF) or vicarious failure (VF). PF students generated solutions to a complex problem targeting the concept of variance that they had not learned yet before receiving instruction on the targeted concept. VF students evaluated the solutions generated by PF students before receiving the same instruction. Student-generated solutions were either suboptimal or incorrect, and in this sense can be conceived as failed problem-solving attempts. Although there was no difference on self-reported engagement, PF students reported significantly greater mental effort and interest in knowing the canonical solution to the problem than VF students. When preexisting differences in general ability, math ability, and prior knowledge were controlled, PF students outperformed VF students on conceptual understanding and transfer without compromising procedural fluency. These results suggest that when learning a new math concept, people learn better from their own failed solutions than those of others provided appropriate instruction on the targeted concept is given after the generation or evaluation activity.},

Although the concept of a complete circuit is covered in the standard undergraduate curriculum, students in all three groups had difficulty in applying this concept to single-loop, resistive circuits. Students frequently did not apply the conservation of current when analyzing circuits containing more than one battery. Certain basic conceptual difficulties spanned all of the populations and even persisted after instruction in upper-division courses that involved analog electronics.},

In a thorough study of 120 undergraduates, in their first OOP course, we noticed a variety of misconceptions and difficulties with a wide range of basic terms and notions. Careful analysis revealed a recurring phenomenon, of fuzzy OOP conceptions, which derive from expansion and reduction of basic term features. Novices tended to expand and/or reduce properties not only of terms such as "class" and "object", but also of terms such as "static", "access", and "instance". Particular misconceptions were of the forms: "One vs. Many". We display a detailed categorization of our findings, in an ordered hierarchical structure, and discuss its cognitive characteristics.},

  title = {Agreement Coefficient for Image Comparison},
  abstract = {Combination of datasets acquired from different sensor systems is necessary to construct a long time-series dataset for remotely sensed land-surface variables. Assessment of the agreement of the data derived from various sources is an important issue in understanding the data continuity through the time-series. Some traditional measures, includ- ing correlation coefficient, coefficient of determination, mean absolute error, and root mean square error, are not always optimal for evaluating the data agreement. For this reason, we developed a new agreement coefficient for comparing two different images. The agreement coefficient has the following properties: non-dimensional, bounded, symmetric, and distinguishable between systematic and unsystematic differences. The paper provides examples
of agreement analyses for hypothetical data and actual remotely sensed data. The results demonstrate that the agreement coefficient does include the above properties, and therefore is a useful tool for image comparison.},

  abstract = {We studied students' conceptions of correctness and their influence on students' correctness-related practices by examining how 159 students had analyzed the correctness of error-free and erroneous algorithms and by interviewing seven students regarding their work. We found that students conceptualized program correctness as the sum of the correctness of its constituent operations and, therefore, they rarely considered programs as incorrect. Instead, as long as they had any operations written correctly students considered the program 'partially correct'. We suggest that this conception is a faulty extension of the concept of a program's grade, which is usually calculated as the sum of points awarded for separate aspects of a program. Thus school (unintentionally) nurtures students' misconception of correctness. This misconception is aligned with students' tendency to employ a line by line verification method - examining whether each operation is translated as a sub-requirement of the algorithm - which is inconsistent with the method of testing that they formally studied.},

  abstract = {For pt.1 see ibid., vol.21, no.4, p. 70-73 (2006). In this paper, we have laid out a theory of sensemaking that might be useful for intelligent systems applications. It's a general, empirically grounded account of sensemaking that goes significantly beyond the myths and puts forward some nonobvious, testable hypotheses about the process. When people try to make sense of events, they begin with some perspective, viewpoint, or framework - however minimal. For now, let's use a metaphor and call this a frame. We can express frames in various meaningful forms, including stories, maps, organizational diagrams, or scripts, and can use them in subsequent and parallel processes. Even though frames define what count as data, they themselves actually shape the data Furthermore, frames change as we acquire data. In other words, this is a two-way street: Frames shape and define the relevant data, and data mandate that frames change in nontrivial ways. We examine five areas of empirical findings: causal reasoning, commitment to hypotheses, feedback and learning, sense-making as a skill, and confirmation bias. In each area the Data/Frame model, and the research it's based on, doesn't align with common beliefs. For that reason, the Data/Frame model cannot be considered a depiction of commonsense views},

  abstract = {Most computer science educators hold strong opinions about the ``right'' approach to teaching introductory level programming. Unfortunately, we have comparatively little hard evidence about the effectiveness of these various approaches because we generally lack the infrastructure to obtain sufficiently detailed data about novices' programming habits. To gain insight into students' programming habits, we developed Marmoset, a project snapshot and submission system. Like existing project submission systems, Marmoset allows students to submit versions of their projects to a central server, which automatically tests them and records the results. Unlike existing systems, Marmoset also collects fine-grained code snapshots as students work on projects: each time a student saves her work, it is automatically committed to a CVS repository. We believe the data collected by Marmoset will be a rich source of insight about learning to program and software evolution in general. To validate the effectiveness of our tool, we performed an experiment which found a statistically significant correlation between warnings reported by a static analysis tool and failed unit tests. To make fine-grained code evolution data more useful, we present a data schema which allows a variety of useful queries to be more easily formulated and answered.},

Two commonly used ontological metaphors for energy are energy as a substance and energy as a vertical location. Our previous work has demonstrated that students and experts can productively use both the substance and location ontologies for energy. In this paper, we use Fauconnier and Turner's conceptual blending framework to demonstrate that experts and novices can successfully blend the substance and location ontologies into a coherent mental model in order to reason about energy. Our data come from classroom recordings of a physics professor teaching a physics course for the life sciences, and from an interview with an undergraduate student in that course. We analyze these data using predicate analysis and gesture analysis, looking at verbal utterances, gestures, and the interaction between them. This analysis yields evidence that the speakers are blending the substance and location ontologies into a single blended mental space.},

Emotions are considered as socially organised and shaped by power relations; we portray emotion as a charge (of energy) attached to ideas or signifiers. We analyse transcripts from a small group solving problems in mathematics class, and from an individual student. The structural phase of analysis identifies positions available to subjects in the specific setting, using Bernstein's sociological approach to pedagogic discourse. The textual phase examines the use of language and other signs in interaction and describes the positionings taken up by particular pupils. We then focus on indicators of emotion, and find indications of excitement and anxiety, linked to participants' positionings. Finally we consider implications of our approach.},

This is a multicase study in which 14 preservice secondary science teachers developed their own empirical investigations\dbend-\dbend{}from formulating questions to defending results in front of peers. Findings indicate that participants shared a tacit framework of what it means to ldquodo sciencerdquo which shaped their investigations and influenced reflections on their inquiries. Some facets of the participants' shared model were congruent with authentic inquiry; however, the most consistent assumptions were misrepresentations of fundamental aspects of science: for example, that a hypothesis functions as a guess about an outcome, but is not necessarily part of a larger explanatory system; that background knowledge may be used to provide ideas about what to study, but this knowledge is not in the form of a theory or other model; and that theory is an optional tool one might use at the end of a study to help explain results. These ideas appear consistent with a ldquofolk theoryrdquo of doing science that is promoted subtly, but pervasively, in textbooks, through the media, and by members of the science education community themselves. Finally, although all participants held degrees in science, the participants who eventually used inquiry in their own classrooms were those who had significant research experiences in careers or postsecondary study and greater science-content background. \dbend{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We relate this hypothesis to two other theoretical constructs, emotional orientations and purposes, which we have used in our research on students' reasoning and teachers' decision making. Given that somatic markers are a part of unconscious mental activity, they cannot be observed by introspective reflection. How then can we research something we cannot see? Beginning with the hypothesis that somatic markers influence actions, we observe, particularly, the actions of student teachers, teachers and children in mathematics classrooms at points where they make decisions. This process is illustrated through examples both of teaching and learning in mathematics, and through the account (see Op't Eynde and Hannula, this issue) of `Frank' reflecting on his decision-making in mathematical activity. We use the case of Frank to illustrate some differences between viewing mathematical activity from our perspective and from those of some other contributors to this special issue. The connections between emotional orientations, somatic markers and purposes are further illustrated by two examples drawn from our research into teacher development and students' reasoning processes.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the results of an experiment which investigated elementary school children's conceptual knowledge about the earth. First-, 3rd-, and 5th-grade children were asked a series of questions about the shape of the earth. Children's responses to these questions revealed considerable apparent inconsistency. For example, many children said that the earth is round but also stated that it has an edge from which people could fall. A great deal of this apparent inconsistency could be explained by assuming that the children used, in a consistent fashion, a mental model of the earth other than the spherical earth model. Five alternative mental modes of the earth were identified: the rectangular earth, the disc earth, the dual earth, the hollow sphere, and the flattened sphere. It is argued that these models are constrained by certain presuppositions which children form based on interpretations of their everyday experience. Some of the models (the rectangular earth and the disc earth) seem to be initial models children construct before they are exposed to the culturally accepted information that the earth is a sphere. In the process of knowledge acquisition, children appear to modify their initial models to make them more consistent with the culturally accepted model by gradually reinterpreting their presuppositions. Synthetic models (such as the hollow sphere and the flattened sphere) are generated by children as a solution to the problems arising from the inconsistency between their initial model of a flat earth and the culturally accepted, scientific model of a spherical earth. Children come to understand that the earth is a sphere only when the presuppositions that gave rise to their initial models have been reinterpreted.},

  doi = {10.1016/0364-0213(90)90028-U},
  abstract = {In this paper I discuss the curious lack of contact between developmental psychologists studying the principles of early learning and those concentrating on later learning in children, where predispositions to learn certain types of concepts are less readily discussed. Instead, there is tacit agreement that learning and transfer mechanisms are content-independent and age-dependent. I argue here that one cannot study learning and transfer in a vacuum and that children's ability to learn is intimately dependent on what they are required to learn and the context in which they must learn it. Specifically, I argue that children learn and transfer readily, even in traditional laboratory settings, if they are required to extend their knowledge about causal mechanisms that they already understand. This point is illustrated in a series of studies with children from 1 to 3 years of age learning about simple mechanisms of physical causality (pushing-pulling, wetting, cutting, etc.). In addition, I document children's difficulty learning about causally impossible events, such as pulling with strings that do not appear to make contact with the object they are pulling. Even young children transfer on the basis of deep structural principles rather than perceptual features when they have access to the requisite domain-specific knowledge. I argue that a search for causal explanations is the basis of broad understanding, of wide patterns of generalization, and of flexible transfer and creative inferential projections\textemdash{}in sum, the essential elements of meaningful learning.},

Students may feel they are being asked to transform their cultural orientation from normative to analytical, from personal to intellectual, from particular to universal, and from experiential to theoretical. They often resist. Differences in worldview between teachers and researchers cannot be eliminated easily because they arise from irreducible differences in the nature of the work that teachers and researchers do.},

To explore this question, we gave an FCI ``split'' task in which 
students indicated the answers they think a scientist would give and 
also indicated the answers they really believe. To interpret the splits 
that students indicated between what they believe and what they were 
taught, we interviewed students about why they split. It turns out that 
a split does not indicate that the student disbelieves the scientist's 
answer. The splits actually arose for other reasons, one of which was 
students indicating a discrepancy between what they were taught and what 
makes sense to them. For this and other reasons, we devised a new split 
task focused on these discrepancies between ``what makes sense'' and 
what a scientist would say. The results of this new experiment, 
including validation interviews, will be discussed briefly. Evidence 
suggests that students are more willing to reconcile physics concepts 
with their everyday experience if epistemological development is an 
explicit goal of instruction.},

  abstract = {We report two studies involving an intelligent tutoring system for Lisp (the Camegie Mellon University Lisp Tutor). In Experiment 1, we developed a model, based on production system theories of transfer and analogical problem solving, that accounts for effects of instructional examples, the transfer of cognitive skills across programming problems, and practice effects. In Experiment 2, we analyzed protocols collected from subjects as they processed instructional texts and examples before working with the Lisp Tutor and protocols collected after subjects solved each programming problem. The results suggest that the acquisition of cognitive skills is facilitated by high degrees of metacognition, which includes higher degrees of monitoring states of knowledge, more self-generated explanation goals and strategies, and greater attention to the instructional structure. Improvement in skill acquisition is also strongly related to the generation of explanations connecting the example material to the abstract terms introduced in the text, the generation of explanations that focus on the novel concepts, and spending more time in planning diminishing returns. Finally, reflection on problem solutions that focus on understanding the abstractions underlying programs or that focus on understanding how programs work seems to be related to improved learning.

  abstract = {Conceptual change is a popular, contemporary conception of meaningful learning. Conceptual change describes changes in conceptual frameworks (mental models or personal theories) that learners construct to comprehend phenomena. Different theories of conceptual change describe the reorganization of conceptual frameworks that results from different forms of activity. We argue that learners' conceptual frameworks (mental models or personal theories) resulting from conceptual change are most acutely affected by model-based reasoning. Model-based reasoning is engaged and fostered by learner construction of qualitative and quantitative models of the content or phenomena they are studying using technology-based modelling tools. Model building is a powerful strategy for engaging, supporting, and assessing conceptual change in learners because these models scaffold and externalize internal, mental models by providing multiple formalisms for representing conceptual understanding and change. We demonstrate the processes and products of building models of domain content, problems, systems, experiences, and thinking processes using different technology-based modelling tools. Each tool provides alternative representational formalisms that enable learners to qualitatively and quantitatively model their conceptual frameworks.

Thirteen well-established scientists from different parts of the world, working in experimental or theoretical research, in both traditional fields such as astrophysics and rapidly growing research fields such as molecular biology, completed an open-ended questionnaire about the NOS and participated in in-depth interviews. The descriptions of their practices provide a somewhat striking contrast to the image of science usually portrayed in science curricula and textbooks. These accounts of authentic scientific practice have considerable potential for development into interesting cases as teaching resources to enhance and enrich students' understanding of NOS and for the design of more effective laboratory work and field experience. \dbend{} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose that learning in engineering involves taking on the discourse of an engineering community, which is intimately bound up with the identity of being a member of that community. This leads to the notion of discursive identity, which emphasises that students' identities are constituted through engaging in discourse. This view of learning implies that success in engineering studies needs to be defined with particular reference to the sorts of identities that students develop and how these relate to identities in the world of work. In order to achieve successful learning in engineering, we need to recognise the multiple identities held by our students, provide an authentic range of engineering-related activities through which students can develop engineering identities and make more explicit key aspects of the discourse of engineering of which lecturers are tacitly aware. We include three vignettes to illustrate how some of the authors of this paper (from across three different institutions) have applied this perspective of learning in their teaching practice.},

The assumption of domain specificity structures handbooks, organizes branches of funding agencies, and provides headings for conference proceedings. Leading researchers often focus on a single slice of the school day despite the possibility that such segments swirl into a blur for children. The authors examine the domain-specific landscape, beginning with the recent past, when domain generality, not domain specificity, reigned supreme. They then examine the transition to domain-specific approaches. Next, they offer an alternative to both positions, a stance they call the comparative understanding of school subjects. A comparative understanding trains attention on how the same children understand multiple subjects in the curriculum. The authors argue that this approach represents a promising path for conceptualizing research on children, schooling, and thinking by raising new questions about children's understandings.},

In this paper, learning is considered from a phenomenographic perspective, which teachers can ground in their own experience of teaching and work with to gain insights into their students' experience of learning. Thereby the theoretical foundation of the culture can successively be strengthened. The message is illustrated with the results of empirical research into students' experience of learning in groups in a project-focused induction course to a computer science and engineering programme.

  abstract = {This case study explores how an American Indian woman experienced scientific discourse and the issues of language, power, and authority that occurred while she was an undergraduate student at a university in the southwestern United States. This ethnographic research, using a phenomenological perspective, describes her experiences as she searched for the discursive resources she required to cross-cultural borders between her traditional worldview and Eurocentric science. Data from interviews, participant observation, and artifacts offer a narrative of how she became aware of the ldquogame rulesrdquo of scientific discourse. The findings are expressed in terms of a cartographic metaphor where the student's world became less of a list of categories and more of a map outlining where she ventured and the ways in which she oriented herself to scientific language. To facilitate the border crossing and reduce the obstacles that some students experience in crossing between worldviews, educators can look at cross-cultural perspectives and explore with students how language fosters or hinders their progress. This research suggests that we allow room in our pedagogy for students to learn the rules of using scientific language, make explicit the cultural norms associated with this practice, thereby promoting a ldquometaknowledgerdquo of how scientific discourse functions in the academy. \dbend{} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

REFRACT's design is based on a problem-solving model of induction. It puts students in a situation where they can learn about a domain that resembles geometrical optics by means of scientific discovery learning: by stating predictions, running experiments, and analyzing results. The student's interaction with the program is organized in a way that provides both structure to the student's task and a window on her hypothesis generation and testing behavior. The system adapts in some sense to students' knowledge by permitting them to state predictions in several ways, ranging from purely qualitative/graphical to quantitative and precise. Observations on students working the REFRACT are reported, focusing on differences with respect to discovery skills and differences in formulating hypotheses either qualitatively or quantitatively.$<$/p$>$},

Work from the mathematics education community suggests that it may be beneficial to consider a broader notion of mathematics: mathematical thinking. Schoenfeld identifies five aspects of mathematical thinking: the mathematics content knowledge we want engineering students to learn as well as problem-solving strategies, use of resources, attitudes and practices. If we further consider the social and material resources available to students and the mathematical practices students engage in, we have a more complete understanding of the breadth of mathematics and mathematical thinking necessary for engineering practice. This article further discusses each of these aspects of mathematical thinking and offers examples of mathematical thinking practices based in the authors' previous empirical studies of engineering students' and practitioners' uses of mathematics. The article also offers insights to inform the teaching of mathematics to engineering students.},

Whereas the first two look on education as a public good, the third sees it as a private good. Historical conflict over these competing visions of education has resulted in a contradictory structure for the educational system that has sharply impaired its effectiveness. More important still has been the growing domination of the social mobility goal, which has reshaped education into a commodity for the purposes of status attainment and has elevated the pursuit of credentials over the acquisition of knowledge.},

In engineering education, work on integrated curricula to help learners build connections between topics began with three programs in 1988. Integrated curricula have connections to a larger movement in higher education- learning communities, which help learners to build interdisciplinary links and social links within a community. Integrated engineering curricula have provided concrete assessment data on retention and student performance to augment research on learning communities. While innovators in both movements have offered many prototypes and gathered many data, goals and results from programs implemented to date are not sufficiently well defined to guide the design and implementation of programs at other institutions. This paper discusses the importance of integration, reviews accomplishments to date, draws conclusions by analyzing those accomplishments, and suggests future initiatives. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

We propose a hierarchical analysis that automatically gives the correct ANOVA comparisons even in complex scenarios. The inferences for all means and variances are performed under a model with a separate batch of effects for each row of the ANOVA table. We connect to classical ANOVA by working with finite-sample variance components: fixed and random effects models are characterized by inferences about existing levels of a factor and new levels, respectively. We also introduce a new graphical display showing inferences about the standard deviations of each batch of effects. We illustrate with two examples from our applied data analysis, first illustrating the usefulness of our hierarchical computations and displays, and second showing how the ideas of ANOVA are helpful in understanding a previously fit hierarchical model.},

We then go beyond this largely pedagogical function and delineate the conceptual and strategic implications of making use of such distinctions with regard to a wide range of phenomena, including control and stress, attitudes, and personality traits. We also provide a specific compendium of analytic procedures appropriate for making the most effective use of the moderator and mediator distinction, both separately and in terms of a broader causal system that includes both moderators and mediators.

  volume = {67},
  issn = {00346543},
  abstract = {My earlier article (Metz, 1995) identified several assumptions about elementary school children's scientific reasoning abilities that have frequently been used for the purpose of framing "developmentally appropriate" science curricula. That article traced the origin of those assumptions to an interpretation of a segment of Piaget's writings and then critiqued those assumptions of the basis of Piaget's corpus, as well as the contemporary cognitive developmental research literature. Given that developmental research constituted the primary base on which I critiqued these assumptions and formulated alternative recommendations, I am surprised by Deanna Kuhn's (1997) contention that the article could be read as suggesting that the developmental literature has "failed" science educators and that they would be advised to look elsewhere to inform their curricular design. Nevertheless, I do consider the relation between cognitive developmental research, as embodied in the contemporary research tradition, and children's science curricula as fundamentally complex. This essay examines three interrelated characteristics of the cognitive developmental research tradition that contribute to the complexity of this relationship: (a) its tendency to attribute shortcomings in performance to the child's stage, with the assumption that these shortcomings will disappear with sufficient advancement of cognitive development; (b) the frequent confounding of weak knowledge with developmentally based cognitive deficiencies; and (c) the emphasis of robust stage-based constraints on children's thinking, to the neglect of variability and change.},

This logic, rehearsed by senior physicists, university administrators, government commissions, individual senators, and newspaper reporters from across the country argued that young graduate students in physics constituted the nation's most precious resource. The purported need to train ever-larger numbers of physics graduate students was often used to justify the structural rearrangements associated with "big science," from huge federally-subsidized budgets to factory-sized equipment. The exigencies of training roomfuls of graduate students, rather than mentoring handfuls of disciples, reinforced the prevailing American pragmatic, instrumentalist approach to theory.},

This paper presents findings from semi-structured interviews that have been validated with a structured survey. Results show that most of the diagrams had a transient nature because of the high cost of changing whiteboard sketches to electronic renderings. Diagrams that documented design decisions were often externalized in these temporary drawings and then subsequently lost. Current visualization tools and the software development practices that we observed do not solve these issues, but these results suggest several directions for future research.},

  title = {On the Substance of a Sophisticated Epistemology},
  volume = {85},
  doi = {10.1002/sce.1023},
  abstract = {Among researchers who study students' epistemologies, a consensus has emerged about what constitutes a sophisticated stance toward scientific knowledge. According to this community consensus, students should understand scientific knowledge as tentative and evolving, rather than certain and unchanging; subjectively tied to scientists' perspectives, rather than objectively inherent in nature; and individually or socially constructed, rather than discovered. Surveys, interview protocols, and other methods used to probe students' beliefs about scientific knowledge broadly reflect this outlook. This article questions the community consensus about epistemological sophistication. We do not suggest that scientific knowledge is objective and fixed; if forced to choose whether knowledge is certain or tentative, with no opportunity to elaborate, we would choose ldquotentative.rdquo Instead, our critique consists of two lines of argument. First, the literature fails to distinguish between the correctness and productivity of an epistemological belief. For instance, elementary school students who believe that science is about discovering objective truths to questions, such as whether the earth is round or flat, or whether an asteroid led to the extinction of the dinosaurs, may be more likely to succeed in science than students who believe science is about telling stories that vary with one's perspective. Na\dbend{}ve realism, although incorrect (according to a broad consensus of philosophers and social scientists), may nonetheless be productive for helping those students learn. Second, according to the consensus view as reflected in commonly used surveys, epistemological sophistication consists of believing certain blanket generalizations about the nature of knowledge and learning, generalizations that do not attend to context. These generalizations are neither correct nor productive. For example, it would be unsophisticated for students to view as tentative the idea that the earth is round rather than flat. By contrast, they should take a more tentative stance toward theories of mass extinction. Nonetheless, many surveys and interview protocols tally students as sophisticated not for attending to these contextual nuances, but for subscribing broadly to the view that knowledge is tentative. \dbend{} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

He suggests that the fundamental property of hard science research is its predictive power, a property that can equally be applied to large- and small-scale and quantitative and qualitative research in education. Although variables may differ and methods of collection may not be the same, researchers do their best to measure and/or control those variables that matter, and design experiments and subsequent tests to ensure that those that can neither be measured nor fully controlled are unlikely to change the results in significant ways. He concludes that although fields like physics or chemistry are mature sciences, the ``cutting-edge'' work in these fields is often ``messy,'' as researchers struggle to determine which variables are important. He suggests that education research often resembles the patterns seen in cutting-edge research in the ``hard'' sciences, as researchers are struggling to identify variables that are important to the problem.},

Using this framework of social production, I analyze a graduate-level college classroom for evidence of Whiteness. More than 50 of the class members were Asian international students. I suggest that Whiteness was operating on multiple levels, which I categorize as: Whiteness as Domination; Resources and the Production of the Other; and the Discourse of Cultural Preference. I argue that Whiteness not only served to deny Asian international students and other students of color an equal opportunity to learn in that classroom, but most pointedly, Whiteness also served to elevate the White students by positioning the students of color as their audience.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.pragma.2004.06.008},
  abstract = {Reasoning processes require stable representations of constraints. There are two principal ways to achieve stability in conceptual models. First, the conceptual models that anthropologists call cultural models achieve representational stability via a combination of intrapersonal and interpersonal processes. Second, the association of conceptual structure with material structure can stabilize conceptual representations. This is an old and pervasive cognitive strategy. Conceptual blending theory provides a useful framework for considering the joint contributions and mutual constraints of mental and material structure. Projecting material structure into a blended space can stabilize the conceptual blend. I call an input space from which material structure is projected into a blend a [`]material anchor' for the blend. The term material anchor is meant to emphasize the stabilizing role of the material structure. In this article, I will present and discuss a number of examples of materially anchored blends, which depend to different degrees on material structure. Materially anchored blends vary on a number of complexly related dimensions, including the extent to which the blend relies on the presence of material structure in the perceptual field, the complexity of the material structure, and whether the material structure was designed to support the blend or is used opportunistically.},

The theory assumes that sustained school success requires identification with school and its subdomains; that societal pressures on these groups (e.g., economic disadvantage, gender roles) can frustrate this identification; and that in school domains where these groups are negatively stereotyped, those who have become domain identified face the further barrier of stereotype threat, the threat that others' judgments or their own actions will negatively stereotype them in the domain. Research shows that this threat dramatically depresses the standardized test performance of women and African Americans who are in the academic vanguard of their groups (offering a new interpretation of group differences in standardized test performance), that it causes disidentification with school, and that practices that reduce this threat can reduce these negative effects.

  abstract = {Researchers have argued against deficit-based explanations of students' difficulties with mathematical sense-making, pointing instead to factors such as epistemology. Students' beliefs about knowledge and learning can hinder the activation and integration of productive knowledge they have. Such explanations, however, risk falling into a "deficit trap"--substituting a concepts/skills deficit with an epistemological one. Our interview-based case study of a freshman engineering major, "Jim," explains his difficulty solving a physics problem (on hydrostatic pressure) in terms of his epistemology, but avoids a deficit trap by modeling the dynamics of his epistemological stabilities and shifts in terms of fine-grained cognitive elements that include the seeds of epistemological expertise. Specifically, during a problem-solving episode in the interview, Jim reaches and sticks with an incorrect answer that violates common sense. We show that Jim has all the mathematical skills and physics knowledge he would need to resolve the contradiction. We argue that his difficulty doing so stems in part from his epistemological views that (i) physics equations are much more trustworthy than everyday reasoning, and (ii) physics equations do not express meaning that tractably connects to common sense. For these reasons, he does not view reconciling between common sense and formalism as either necessary or plausible to accomplish. But Jim's in-the-moment shift to a more sophisticated epistemological stance highlights the seeds of epistemological expertise that were present all along: he does see common sense as connected to formalism (though not always tractably so), and in some circumstances, this connection is both salient and valued.

In Experiment 1, participants learned material by interacting with AutoTutor or by viewing 1 of 4 vicarious learning conditions: a noninteractive recorded version of the AutoTutor dialogues, a dialogue with a deep-level-reasoning question preceding each sentence, a dialogue with a deep-level-reasoning question preceding half of the sentences, or a monologue. Learners in the condition where a deep-level-reasoning question preceded each sentence significantly outperformed those in the other 4 conditions. Experiment 2 included the same interactive and noninteractive recorded condition, along with 2 vicarious learning conditions involving deep-level-reasoning questions. Both deep-level-reasoning-question conditions significantly outperformed the other conditions. These findings provide evidence that deep-level-reasoning questions improve vicarious learning.

We designed the course to tap into students' productive conceptual and epistemological resources, based on a theoretical framework from research on learning. The reformed class retains its traditional structure in terms of time and instructional personnel, but we modified existing best-practices curricular materials. We provided class-controlled spaces for student collaboration, which allowed us to observe and record students learning directly. We also scanned all written homework and examinations and administered pre-post conceptual and epistemological surveys. The reformed class enhanced the strong gains on pre-post conceptual tests produced by the best-practices materials while obtaining unprecedented pre-post gains on epistemological surveys instead of the traditional losses.},

  note = {Neither interpretive nor process-product classroom research has foregrounded the teacher's role in the generation of knowledge about teaching. What is missing from the knowledge base for teaching, therefore, are the voices of the teachers themselves, the questions teachers ask, the ways teachers use writing and intentional talk in their work lives, and the interpretive frames teachers use to understand and improve their own classroom practices. Limiting the official knowledge base for teaching to what academics have chosen to study and write about has contributed to a number of problems, including discontinuity between what is taught in universities and what is taught in classrooms, teachers' ambivalence about the claims of academic research, and a general lack of information about classroom life from a truly emic perspective. This article proposes that teacher research has the potential to provide this perspective; however, several critical issues divide teacher research from research on teaching and make it difficult for the university-based community to acknowledge its potential. The article also proposes that in order to encourage teacher research, the educational community will need to address incentives for teachers, the creation and maintenance of supportive networks, the reform of organizational patterns in schools, and the hierarchical power relationships that characterize much of schooling.},

  abstract = {This article sets forth a way of connecting the classroom instructional environment with individual students' generalizations. To do so, we advance the notion of focusing phenomena, that is, regularities in the ways in which teachers, students, artifacts, and curricular materials act together to direct attention toward certain mathematical properties over others. The construct of focusing phenomena emerged from an empirical study conducted during a 5-week unit on slope and linear functions in a high school classroom using a reform curriculum. Qualitative evidence from interviews with 7 students revealed that students interpreted the m value in y = b + mx as a difference rather than a ratio as a result of counterproductive generalization afforded by focusing phenomena. Classroom analysis revealed 4 focusing phenomena, which regularly directed students' attention to various sets of differences rather than to the coordination of quantities. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Drawing on data from the third author's third-grade class, we show evidence of children's productive conceptual and epistemological resources for understanding energy.

Within this approach, abstract ideas and the planning of investigations and analysis of their results are in large part postponed until higher grades. This practice stems from purported developmental constraints on children's thinking. This article analyzes these constraints in light of the writings of Piaget, to whom they are frequently attributed, and contemporary developmental theory and research. Neither the Piagetian nor the non-Piagetian research supports the validity of these developmental assumptions. The article also identifies several intrinsic problematic aspects of this approach to children's science, including the failure to appreciate the challenge of adequate scientific description, the liabilities of decontextualization, and the epistemological messages it conveys to children. Both Piagetian and non-Piagetian literatures support the feasibility of children's science curricula in which the processes previously approached as ends become tools in contextualized and authentic scientific inquiry.},

  abstract = {A theoretical framework is outlined in this article that attempts to explain the nature of conceptual change that takes place in the learning of physical science. It is argued that a naive framework theory of physics is established early on in infancy and forms the basis of individuals' ontology and epistemology. The presuppositions of this framework theory act as constraints on the way individuals interpret their observations and the information they receive from the culture to construct specific theories about the physical world. The specific theories formed through this process are continuously enriched and modified. Some kinds of conceptual change require the simple addition of new information to an existing conceptual structure. Others are accomplished only when existing beliefs and presuppositions are revised. It is proposed that conceptual change is particularly difficult to achieve and very likely to give rise to misconceptions when it requires the revision of fundamental presuppositions of the framework theory. Misconceptions are interpreted as individuals' attempts to assimilate new information into existing conceptual structures that contain information contradictory to the scientific view.},

Although mathematics education researchers and reformers give attention to equity, work in this area tends to ignore relevant social and cultural issues. I begin by surveying articles on equity published in recent, mainstream education journals, highlighting the lack of attention given to social class and ethnicity. I discuss the implications of this limited research base. Specifically, I argue that current mathematics education reforms have been shaped by good intentions and existing research, neither of which offers adequate guidance to address the complexities of equity in mathematics classrooms today. Drawing from a study of social class differences in students' experiences in one reform-oriented classroom, I discuss the challenges and dilemmas inherent in sociocultural approaches to research in mathematics education and their potential contributions. I call for research from a sociocultural perspective, focusing on ways in which students from underrepresented groups can struggle when encountering particular instructional approaches, and ways in which teachers and students are able to address such struggles.

These self-explanations are guided by accurate monitoring of their own understanding and misunderstanding. Such learning results in example-independent knowledge and in a better understanding of the principles presented in the text. "Poor" students do not generate sufficient self-explanations, monitor their learning inaccurately, and subsequently rely heavily on examples. We then discuss the role of self-explanations in facilitating problem solving, as well as the adequacy of current AI models of explanation-based learning to account for these psychological findings.},

There were significant differences in performance between groups of students.This result could lead one to two possible conclusions. One might be that some students' learning styles are more suited to learning programming than others.An alternative explanation is that our current methods of teaching advantage students with certain learning preference styles. We are at present in the process of testing this second assumption by providing students with a wider range of learning materials. We will then see if student performance is improved by using our current results as a baseline for comparison},

atomic masses, leading to work with formulae and equations, then aids
the interpretation of many chemical observations obtained earlier and

fashion without supporting evidence some teachers choose to mention
briefly the most modern methods of mass determination using the mass

Debates such as this regarding subtleties of cognitive theory, however, may be difficult to connect to everyday instructional practice. Our purpose in this article is to make that connection. We first review reasons for supporting the latter account, of naive epistemologies as made up of fine-grained, context-sensitive resources; as part of this argument we note that familiar strategies and curricula tacitly ascribe epistemological resources to students. We then present several strategies designed more explicitly to help students tap those resources for learning introductory physics. Finally, we reflect on this work as an example of interplay between 2 modes of inquiry into student thinking, that of instruction and that of formal research on learning.},

However, although there is a growing body of work on scaffolded tools, scaffold design, and the impact of scaffolding, the field has not yet converged on a common theoretical framework that defines rationales and approaches to guide the design of scaffolded tools. In this article, we present a scaffolding design framework addressing scaffolded software tools for science inquiry. Developed through iterative cycles of inductive and theory-based analysis, the framework synthesizes the work of prior design efforts, theoretical arguments, and empirical work in a set of guidelines that are organized around science inquiry practices and the challenges learners face in those practices. The framework can provide a basis for developing a theory of pedagogical support and a mechanism to describe successful scaffolding approaches. It can also guide design, not in a prescriptive manner but by providing designers with heuristics and examples of possible ways to address the challenges learners face.},

To do so, we advance the notion of sociomathematical norms, that is, normative aspects of mathematical discussions that are specific to students' mathematical activity. The explication of sociomathematical norms extends our previous work on general classroom social norms that sustain inquiry-based discussion and argumentation. Episodes from a second-grade classroom where mathematics instruction generally followed an inquiry tradition are used to clarify the processes by which sociomathematical norms are interactively constituted and to illustrate how these norms regulate mathematical argumentation and influence learning opportunities for both the students and the teacher. In doing so, we both clarify how students develop a mathematical disposition and account for students' development of increasing intellectual autonomy in mathematics. In the process, the teacher's role as a representative of the mathematical community is elaborated.},

More specifically, we tried to answer the following five critical questions. What components does young children's knowledge system for biological phenomena (or naive biology) have? What functions does it have in children's lives? How is it acquired in ontogenesis? How does its early version change as children grow older? Is it universal across cultures and through history? We propose that young children's biological knowledge system has at least three components, that is, knowledge needed to specify the target objects of biology, ways of inferring attributes or behaviors of biological kinds, and a non-intentional causal explanatory framework, and that these three constitute a form of biology, which is adaptive in children's lives. We also claim that the core of naive biology is acquired based on specific cognitive constraints as well as the general mechanism of personification and the resultant vitalistic causality, but it is differently instantiated and elaborated through activity-based experiences in the surrounding culture.},

  abstract = {Abstract  Students in a mathematics classroom are motivated to do many things, not only the ones we expect them to do. In order to understand student behaviour in classrooms we need to increase our understanding of what motivation is and how it is regulated. Two issues relevant to a critique of mainstream motivation research need consideration: (a) the importance of the unconscious in motivation and (b) focusing on motivational states and processes rather than traits. In the present paper, motivation is conceptualised as a potential to direct behaviour through the mechanisms that control emotion. As a potential, motivation cannot be directly observed. It is observable only as it manifests itself in affect and cognition, for example as beliefs, values and emotional reactions. This potential is structured through needs and goals. Based on this view of motivation and the author's earlier studies, three aspects of motivation regulation are discussed. Primarily, goals are derived from needs: in learning situations, the psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and social belonging are the most significant determinants of goal choices. As a second aspect, this view accepts the influence of students' beliefs about the accessibility of different goals. As a third aspect, the influence of automatic emotional reactions for goal regulation will be discussed. The case of Frank will be used 1) to illustrate how motivation can be inferred from different kinds of data and 2) as an example of how conflicting goals lead to non-straightforward self-regulation.},

As a result of this research, the social practices of inscription users came into focus, and individual mental activity was deemphasized. Inscriptions and inscription-related practices highlight aspects of representations and representing not captured by other theoretical frameworks.

Significant efforts to disseminate these strategies have focused on convincing individual instructors to give up their traditional practices in favor of particular research-based practices. Yet evidence suggests that the findings of educational research are, at best, only marginally incorporated into typical introductory physics courses. In this paper we present partial results of an interview study designed to generate new ideas about why proven strategies are slow to integrate in mainstream instruction. Specifically we describe the results of open-ended interviews with five physics instructors who represent likely users of educational research. We found that these instructors have conceptions about teaching and learning that are more compatible with educational research than with their self-described instructional practices. Instructors often blamed this discrepancy on situational factors that favor traditional instruction. A theoretical model is introduced to explain these findings.},

A main way to facilitate learning is to engage students in inquiry activities such as conducting experiments. This article presents a theoretical framework for evaluating inquiry tasks in terms of how similar they are to authentic science. The framework helps identify the respects in which these reasoning tasks are similar to and different from real scientific research. The framework is based on a recent theory of reasoning, models-of-data theory. We argue that inquiry tasks commonly used in schools evoke reasoning processes that are qualitatively different from the processes employed in real scientific inquiry. Moreover, school reasoning tasks appear to be based on an epistemology that differs from the epistemology of authentic science. Inquiry tasks developed by researchers have increasingly captured features of authentic science, but further improvement is still possible. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our analysis for research, assessment, and instruction. \textcopyright{} 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Math-education reformers encourage the incorporation of mathematical modeling activities into K-12 curricula. Many of the purported educational benefits derive from the authenticity of the activities-how well they reflect the everyday and occupational mathematical practices of adults. But a paucity in the literature of observational descriptions of adult modeling behavior has made it difficult to judge the authenticity of classroom activities and their potential to prepare students for out-of-school problem solving. The ethnographic study reported here investigated the everyday problem-solving activity of structural engineers in practice. Modeling was found to be central to and ubiquitous in the engineers' work, giving rise to some of their greatest intellectual challenges. These engineers use, adapt, and create models of various representation forms and degrees of abstraction. Two major challenges of modeling emerged: understanding inaccessible phenomena and keeping track of models. These challenges, and the nature of engineering models themselves, are not well reflected in the modeling tasks typically prescribed for the K-12 classroom, which will likely limit their educational benefits.

Instruction was designed to provide rich opportunities for exploring numbers, number relationships, and number operations and to discover rules and invent algorithms. Written measures and interviews before instruction, immediately after instruction, and several months later revealed that after instruction students were more likely to elect to use strategies that reflected number sense and that this was a long-term change. It appeared to the investigators that the students reorganized and used existing knowledge rather than acquiring new knowledge structures.},

In short, conceptual artifacts (World 3) like theories are products of human minds that result from personal thinking and experience (World 2) and are encrypted through language, signs and symbols on some physical media (World 1). Examined from this perspective, knowledge creation necessitates design thinking, and ICT facilitates this process by providing a historical record of the development of ideas and allows for juxtapositions of ideas to create new ideas. The implication for education is that educators and researchers should develop students' epistemic repertoires, or ways or knowing, so as to create cognitive artifacts to make sense of the problems and challenges that a student encounters.},

The alternative model, by contrast, looks at socialization outcomes at both the institutional and individual levels, and differs from the traditional models in acknowledging the impact of the individual on socialization processes and outcomes. It also differs in stressing  the interaction between student background characteristics and aspects of the socialization process itself. This framework suggests that socialization into the professions should be conceived as a series of processes in which the novice: (1) enters the educational institution with values, beliefs, and attitudes about self and professional practices; (2) is exposed to various socializing influences while in school; (3) assesses the salience of the normative pressures for attaining personal and professional goals; and (4) assumes, changes, or maintains his/her original values and goals.

I review briefly some basic premises of first ethnomethodological, then activity theoretic studies of artifacts-in-use. I then offer a preliminary account of computer-aided and paper-based design work in civil engineering, informed by both perspectives. My account emphasizes the multiplicity of media and associated objects involved in the work of engineering on the one hand, and their integration in practice into a coherent field of action on the other.

This study examines how aspects of generality are produced through the situated activities of a group of middle school mathematics students working on an 8-week population-modeling project. The project involved creating and analyzing mathematical models of population growth. Two classroom episodes are presented that focus on students' activities across curricular tasks in which they discuss the category of sensible models of population growth and describe a pattern of guppy population growth in a natural environment. Participation frameworks introduced in the context of the episodes describe how students compare situations to determine if they belong to the same general category and predict and justify the behavior of modeled phenomena. The analysis suggests that mathematical generalizing is the outcome of processes distributed across students, tasks, embodied activity, and modeling tools. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

To be effective as teaching tools, exhibits need to be highly intrinsically motivating at every step of an interaction in order to sustain involvement by an audience who views their visit primarily as a leisure activity. Given these challenges, it is vital to support the design process with a strong program of research and evaluation. I give a personal perspective on one institution's research and evaluation work over the last decade, focusing on four areas: immediate apprehendability, physical interactivity, conceptual coherence, and diversity of learners. \textcopyright{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Effortful interaction is a form of human-computer interaction where different degrees of physical effort are intentionally incorporated into the interaction design in order to communicate information. In this sense effortful interaction is similar to haptics, where devices provide physical force feedback to users, except the perceived feedback occurs entirely within users' proprioception: i.e., users' perception of their own bodies. Our larger design goal is to use effortful interaction to communicate quantitative information to children who aren't yet proficient with graphs. First, though, we had to establish if we could reliably induce sensations of effort. This study examined the sensitivity of children to three different design parameters (the duration of interaction, the intensity required by the interaction, and the physical modality of the interaction), and compares their responses to those of adults.},

I present a microgenetic analysis that tracks how one student's attention to elements of computer program state shifted during his debugging process. I present evidence that this student had relevant domain knowledge and claim that his changing attention within the problem, and not his domain knowledge, mediated his debugging process. I hypothesize that a key competence in debugging is learning to identify what elements of program state are important to pay attention to and that this attention, and not only domain knowledge, mediates the debugging process. This hypothesis is consistent with a model of physics reasoning and learning from the Knowledge in Pieces theoretical framework and in this research I build upon education research outside of computer science. The case study analyzes the debugging process of a student entering the sixth grade, but I document an isomorphic case from a pair of college students to show that this pattern extends beyond this age.},

It is argued that explanatory idiographic studies that are informed by a realist epistemology are, indeed, in a position to make general claims about the world. For realists, generality is distinguished from recurrent regularities; instead, it is ascribed to the operation of causal tendencies (or powers). The latter act in their normal way even when expected regularities do not occur. This is possible because the realization of causal tendencies is contingent upon specific circumstances, which may or may not favor the generation of certain patterns of events. Idiographic research conceptualizes the causal capability of structures, while at the same time it sheds light on the contingent manner through which a set of postulated causal powers interact and gives rise to the flux of the phenomena under study.},

My window into this issue is the core problem of determining the stability of model rockets, across phases of design, construction, and flying. Using ethnographic and experimental data, I catalog the various individual and collective ways of knowing rocket stability and articulate the manners in which they operate to foster and sustain the highly tailored pursuits characteristic of interest-based practices.},

  abstract = {It is widely known that students often treat examples that satisfy a certain universal statement as sufficient for showing that the statement is true without recognizing the conventional need for a general proof. Our study focuses on special cases in which examples satisfy certain universal statements, either true or false in a special type of mathematical task, which we term ``Is this a coincidence?''. In each task of this type, a geometrical example was chosen carefully in a way that appears to illustrate a more general and potentially surprising phenomenon, which can be seen as a conjecture. In this paper, we articulate some design principles underlying the choice of examples for this type of task, and examine how such tasks may trigger a need for proof. Our findings point to two different kinds of ways of dealing with the task. One is characterized by a doubtful disposition regarding the generality of the observed phenomenon. The other kind of response was overconfidence in the conjecture even when it was false. In both cases, a need for ``proof'' was evoked; however, this need did not necessarily lead to a valid proof. We used this type of task with two different groups: capable high school students and experienced secondary mathematics teachers. The findings were similar in both groups.},

  abstract = {This chapter argues that for the science of learning to become a fully "human" science, it needs to move from viewing learning from an exogenous perspective to an endogenous one. Taken from Latin, the term "endogenous" translates roughly to "from within," and in the meaning the author gives to it here, it refers to a perspective on learning from the perspective of learners. The exogenous approach examines learning "from without," and it is the dominant approach to understanding learning in the field, from Thorndike's behaviorism to the current day. In this chapter, the author traces the roots of an endogenous science of learning and develops concepts and techniques for conducting research on learning as a members' phenomenon (LAMP). This examination is anchored by a detailed analysis of a single interactional segment. His analysis of this segment leads him to treat this as a simplest case of LAMP, thus establishing something like "criteria for an ethnographically adequate" account of learning. Issues and future directions for an endogenous science of learning are also discussed. (Contains 1 figure and 1 note.)},

  shorttitle = {Making Mathematics on Paper},
  abstract = {This dissertation takes up the problem of applied quantitative inference as a central question for cognitive science, asking what must happen during problem solving for people to obtain a meaningful and effective representation of the problem. The core of the dissertation reports exploratory empirical studies that seek to answer the descriptive question of how quantitative inferences are generated, pursued, and evaluated by problem solvers with different mathematical backgrounds. These are framed against a controversy, described in Chapter 2, over the theoretical and empirical validity of current cognitive science accounts of problems, solutions, knowledge, and competent human activity outside of laboratory or school settings. Chapter 3 describes a written protocol study of algebra story problem solving among advanced undergraduates in computer science. A relatively open-ended interpretive framework for "problem-solving episodes" is developed and applied to their written solution attempts. The resulting description of problem-solving activities gives a surprising image of competence among an important occupational target for standard mathematics instruction. Chapter 4 follows these results into detailed verbal problem-solving interviews with algebra students and teachers. These provide a comparison across settings and levels of competence for the same set of problems. The results corroborate similar generative activities outside the standard formalism of algebra across levels of competence. Notable among these nonalgebraic problem-solving activities are "model-based reasoning tactics," in which people reason about quantitative relations in terms of the dimensional structure of functional relations described in the problem. These tactics support different activities within surrounding solution attempts and usually describe "states" in the problem's situational structure. Chapter 5 holds these activities accountable to local combinations of notation and quantity, reinterpreting results for model-based reasoning in an ecological analysis of material designs for constructing and evaluating quantitative inferences. This analysis brings forward important relations between what material designs afford problem solvers and the complexity of episodic structure observed in their solution attempts. The dissertation closes with a reappraisal of the relationship between knowledge, person, and setting and, I will argue, puts us on a more promising track for a descriptively adequate theoretical account of constructing mathematical representations that support applied quantitative inference.},

  abstract = {Previous research has documented the importance of constructing a good representation for understanding and solving problems. Symbolic representations (e.g., matrices and node link networks) in particular are good for conceptualizing the underlying structure of many problems. Because solvers often do not construct appropriate symbolic representations for problems, the authors examined whether solvers can transfer such representations from an example problem to a nonisomorphic target problem. They found evidence of such transfer in college students for 4 different symbolic representations; 3 were diagrammatic (matrix, hierarchy, and network representations), whereas 1 was more purely conceptual (a part-whole representation). The 4 experiments reported in this article enabled the authors to identify several key component processes of representational transfer, as well as some of the factors affecting their execution. On the basis of the results of the experiments, as well as on a comparison of the apparent requirements of representational and procedural (i.e., analogical) transfer, the authors propose a model of the component processes underlying representational transfer.

  abstract = {In current science education reform, two criteria are considered most critical for determining whether or not an external representation is pedagogically productive. One is whether or not the representation maintains a high level of epistemic fidelity. The other is whether or not the representation is transparent relative to the content it is supposed to represent. We believe that these criteria are too limited in scope and have been considered acceptable in part because we have a very limited understanding of how students construct meaningful interpretations of unfamiliar representations. To remedy that, we propose a new framework for understanding acts of interpretation that focuses on four major constructs: registrations, symbolic forms, interpretive genres, and interpretive maxims. We demonstrate this framework's utility by applying it to excerpts of middle school students interpreting unfamiliar representations of light reflection.},

Thirty-six in-service mathematics teachers and 67 preservice mathematics teachers participated in the study. All participants were presented with a task calling for the generation of a counterexample, namely, a binary operation that is commutative but not associative. Responses to the task were analyzed according to four categories: correctness, productiveness, mathematical content, and underlying difficulties. The findings point to similarities and differences between the two groups. Both groups exhibited a weak concept by failing to produce a correct example and by using a limited content search-space. These findings suggest two main inhibiting factors: one related to the overgeneralization of the properties of basic binary operations and the other related to pseudo-similarities attributed to these properties, which seem to be created by the recurring theme of order. Teachers were superior to student teachers on the categories of correctness and productiveness.},

Our findings reveal that the different figured worlds of the science classroom, such as whole class, small group work, and individual work, offered Melanie different affordances for identity formation that were built upon across such spaces, in both productive and unproductive ways. Our findings also take up the kinds of critical roles that members of her classroom community, in particular teacher and peers, play in supporting and constraining such a transformation. We discuss the implications identity formation has for understanding issues of gender equity and science learning. \dbend{} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed 92:567-590, 2008},

In this paper we outline the iterative design process used for the adaptation and present our progress toward establishing the instrument's validity. We present results of think-aloud interviews and discuss procedures used to determine expert consensus for CAS items. We also detail results of a pilot of the instrument with 447 introductory students in Fall 2011 along with a preliminary factor analysis of this data. Findings to date show consistent interpretation of statements by faculty and students, establish expert consensus of opinion and identify eight candidate factors for further analysis.},

From our perspective as participants in some of this activity, we argue that there are important differences among these definitions and their purposes. Furthermore, we suggest that the various definitions, together with public input about them, can provide leverage for altering the meanings of scientifically based research and education research that are being operationalized in current public policy.},

The anthropology of expertise focuses on what people do rather than what people possess, even in the many circumstances where the former is naturalized as the latter. Across its many domains, expertise is both inherently interactional, involving the participation of objects, producers, and consumers of knowledge, and inescapably ideological, implicated in the evolving hierarchies of value that legitimate particular ways of knowing as ``expert.'' This review focuses on the semiotics of expertise, highlighting four constitutive processes: socialization practices through which people establish intimacy with classes of cultural objects and learn to communicate that familiarity; evaluation, or the establishment of asymmetries among people and between people and objects; institutionalization, wherein ways of knowing are organized and authorized; and naturalization, or the essentialization of expert enactments as bodies of knowledge.},

This gives rise to a broad understanding of the theoretical basis of CER that is useful for researchers working in that area, and has the potential to help CER develop its own identity as an independent field of study. Our analysis takes in seven years of publications (2005-2011, 308 papers) in three venues that publish long research papers in computing education: the journals ACM Transactions of Computing Education (TOCE) and Computer Science Education (CSEd), and the conference International Computing Education Research Workshop (ICER). We looked at the theoretical background works that are used or extended in the papers, not just referred to when describing related work. These background works include theories, conceptual models and frameworks. For each background work we tried to identify the discipline from which it originates, to gain an understanding of how CER relates to its neighboring fields. We also identified theoretical works originating within CER itself, showing that the field is building on its own theoretical works. Our main findings are that there is a great richness of work on which recent CER papers build; there are no prevailing theoretical or technical works that are broadly applied across CER; about half the analyzed papers build on no previous theoretical work, but a considerable share of these are building their own theoretical constructions. We discuss the significance of these findings for the whole field and conclude with some recommendations.},

  abstract = {The ability to make decisions based on data, with its inherent uncertainties and variability, is a complex and vital skill in the modern world. The need for such quantitative critical thinking occurs in many different contexts, and although it is an important goal of education, that goal is seldom being achieved. We argue that the key element for developing this ability is repeated practice in making decisions based on data, with feedback on those decisions. We demonstrate a structure for providing suitable practice that can be applied in any instructional setting that involves the acquisition of data and relating that data to scientific models. This study reports the results of applying that structure in an introductory physics laboratory course. Students in an experimental condition were repeatedly instructed to make and act on quantitative comparisons between datasets, and between data and models, an approach that is common to all science disciplines. These instructions were slowly faded across the course. After the instructions had been removed, students in the experimental condition were 12 times more likely to spontaneously propose or make changes to improve their experimental methods than a control group, who performed traditional experimental activities. The students in the experimental condition were also four times more likely to identify and explain a limitation of a physical model using their data. Students in the experimental condition also showed much more sophisticated reasoning about their data. These differences between the groups were seen to persist into a subsequent course taken the following year.},

Although an asserted parallel between these underpins reform, little is actually known about this relation. This article offers a model of this relation that draws coherent connections between the science studies literature, which suggests ways of conceiving how scientific knowledge is created; and sociocultural learning theory, which suggests ways of conceiving scientific reasoning. This model highlights a dialectic between construction and critique of claims in both scientific reasoning and practice. A ``grasp'' of scientific practice as such is instrumental to learning because informational content of scientific knowledge lies not only on the level of facts, but also on the levels of methods and values, and coordinating information across these levels is crucial for understanding. In contrast to prevailing constructivist ideas that highlight student authority to construct knowledge as scientists do, this model emphasizes the importance of knowing how to hold claims accountable. Thus, the ideal vision of students making their own sense of content is superceded by a more defensible ideal vision of students learning how to make scientific sense of content. \textcopyright{} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In addressing such an issue, we first propose an epistemological discussion based on the works of Cartwright (1983, 1999), Fleck (1935/1979), and Hacking (1983). This leads us to emphasize the transitions between the abstract and the concrete in the modeling process, by using the notions of nomogical machine (Cartwright, 1999), language game (Wittgenstein, 1953/1997), and thought style (Fleck, 1935/1979). Then, in the light of our epistemological approach, we study four cases coming from the implementations of research-based design activities (SESAMES, 2007). These four case studies illustrate how students are engaged in constructing relations between the abstract and the concrete through modeling activities, by elaborating at the same time specific language games and appropriate thought styles. Finally, we draw some implications for science teaching. It is suggested that considering didactic nomological machines as embedding knowledge on the one hand, and classes as thought collectives, on the other hand, may relevantly contribute to science education and science education research. \textcopyright{} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We call this paradigm Instructionless Learning. The present paper presents a detailed account of how people learn about a complex device in an instructionless-learning context. Subjects' behavior is divided into an orientation phase and a systematic phase. We attend most carefully to the systematic phase. Learners form hypotheses about various aspects of the Big Trak: the syntax of interaction, the semantics of operators, and the device model\textemdash{}which includes objects such as memories, switches, etc. Subjects attempt to confirm hypotheses from which predictions can be made, to refine hypotheses that do not immediately yield predictions, and to verify their total knowledge of the device. Hypotheses are formulated from observation. If an initial hypothesis is incorrect, it will yield incorrect predictions in interactions. When such failures occur, learners change their theory to account for the currently perceived behavior of the device. These changes are often based upon little evidence and may even be contradicted by available information. Thus, the new hypotheses may also be incorrect, and lead to further errors and changes.},

  shorttitle = {The {{Dynamics}} of {{Variability}} in {{Introductory Physics Students}}' {{Thinking}}},
  abstract = {Physics education research has long emphasized the need for physics instruction to address students' existing intuitions about the physical world as an integral part of learning physics. Researchers, however, have not reached a consensus-view concerning the nature of this intuitive knowledge or the specific role that it does (or might) play in physics learning. While many early characterizations of student misconceptions cast students' intuitive thinking as largely static, unitary in structure, and counter-productive for the purpose of learning correct physics, much of contemporary research supports a conceptualization of intuitive thought as dynamic, manifold in structure, and generative in the development of expertise. This dissertation contributes to ongoing inquiry into the nature of students' intuitive thought and its role in learning physics through the pursuit of dynamic systems characterizations of student reasoning, with a particular focus on how students settle into and shift among multiple patterns of reasoning about motion. 

In one thread of this research, simple experimental designs are used to demonstrate how individual students can be predictably biased toward and away from different ways of thinking about the same physical situation when specific parameters of questions posed to students are varied. I qualitatively model students' thinking in terms of the activations and interactions among fine-grained intuitive knowledge and static features of the context. In a second thread of this research, case studies of more dynamic shifts in students' conceptual reasoning are developed from videos of student discussions during collaborative classroom activities. These show multiple local stabilities of students' thinking as well, with evidence of group-level dynamics shifting on the time scale of minutes. 

	This work contributes to existing research paradigms that aim to characterize student thinking in physics education in two important ways: (1) through the use of methods that allow for forms of empirical accountability that connect descriptive models of student thinking to experimental data, and (2) through the theoretical development of explanatory mechanisms that account for patterns in students' reasoning at multiple levels of analysis.},

  abstract = {Increasingly, instructional improvement efforts include teacher communities as part of their overall strategy, yet the relationship between teachers' talk and professional learning remains underspecified. Using a discourse perspective on learning, this article compares opportunities to learn (OTLs) in the collaborative conversations of 3 mathematics teacher workgroups. We examined the differences in OTLs in 17 hr of videotaped meetings from 3 groups at different levels of instructional accomplishment in secondary mathematics. Using mixed methods, we uncovered differences in the groups' interactions and found that OTLs were not equally distributed. Instead, teacher groups whose active participants demonstrated the greatest facility with ambitious instruction also had the richest conversational OTLs. We interpret this as an accumulated advantage developmental story: Because collaborative work in teaching involves problem posing and the articulation of practice, teachers' conceptions get built into the framing and discussion of pedagogical problems. Accomplished teachers are thus positioned to learn more from talking with colleagues. This analysis contributes to understanding of how OTLs are constituted in teacher workgroups, with implications for making better use of teacher collaboration for professional learning.},

  abstract = {Well-designed games can scaffold student learning (Clark, Nelson, Sengupta, \& D'Angelo, 2009). Research on games for learning, however, has generally focused on investigating overall effectiveness of games or designs rather than analyzing the specific processes of conceptual change through which students learn. In this paper, we present a case study in the form of microgenetic analysis of a student's processes of knowledge construction as he played a conceptually-integrated digital game (SURGE Next) designed to support learning about Newtonian mechanics. We present the key characteristics of SURGE Next responsible for conceptual integration, and grounded in the Knowledge In Pieces framework of conceptual change (diSessa, 1993; Smith, diSessa \& Roschelle, 1993), identify the process through which the student, Jamal, developed an expert-like understanding of deflections, a phenomenon that has been previously identified as challenging to understand for novice physics learners (diSessa, 1993). Our analysis shows that Jamal's conceptual change involved iterative refinement of his conceptual understanding through a process known as distributed encoding (diSessa, 1993). That is, as Jamal advanced through the game levels in SURGE Next, he developed a progressively more distributed sense of mechanism (diSessa, 1993). This in turn enabled Jamal to identify and operationalize the roles of the direction and magnitude of an object's initial (or previous) velocity in determining the velocity resulting from the application of a new impulse. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of conceptually-integrated games for learning as well as the implications of the research methodology for future research on games for science learning.},

The book is often discussed with reference to ethnographic fieldwork, sometimes being cited as if it were a field study.

Based upon this exploration, it argues that social analysis in HCI does not necessitate fieldwork outside the laboratory. More broadly, the paper argues that an appreciation of Plans and Situated Actions can help in moving towards forms of social analysis that span both the laboratory and the world outside. If there is to be a ``turn to the wild'' in HCI, this should not be a turn away from the laboratory but a turn away from research methods that ignore human practice. This is not to defend laboratory experiments, but to defend laboratory-based studies that explicate technology in practice.},

Consequential learning changes one's relation to conceptual practice, creating access to and valued possibilities for participation in practices at a broader scale.

  title = {Racial Discourse in Mathematics and Its Impact on Student Learning, Identity, and Participation.},
  abstract = {Discussions of race in educational research have focused primarily on performance gaps and differential access to advanced coursework. Thus, very little is known about how race mediates the learning process, particularly with respect to classroom participation and student identity formation. This dissertation examines mathematics learning as a context for illuminating the racial dynamics of learning in everyday classroom activity. Although mathematics and race may seem strange bedfellows, a poststructural analysis reveals specific linkages between them that suggest that their discourses are actually well aligned. To conceptualize this alignment, this dissertation introduces the theoretical frame of racial-mathematical discourse, which establishes the groundwork for the empirical investigation reported here. Observations took place in four mathematics classrooms at a racially diverse high school over the course of a school year. Interviews (n=35) were conducted with students from the focal classrooms. Data were analyzed to explore how students make sense of racial-mathematical discourse, and to gauge the discourse's impact on learning. Findings indicate that racial-mathematical narratives were central to students' sense making. All students reported awareness of the "Asians are good at math" narrative, as part of a web of racial ideology. Importantly, students linked it to narratives about other groups' mathematical inferiority (e.g., "Blacks are bad at math"). They also connected racial-mathematical narratives to broader racialized discourses outside mathematics (e.g., perceptions of intelligence). Students observed the presence of these narratives in locations outside the school setting, such as media imagery and international comparisons. Data further suggest that racial-mathematical discourse is not a static belief system. Rather, it emerges and is reified as students engage in typical classroom practices, such as noting which classmates get asked for help. This is consequential for learning, in that the deployment of racial narratives in social interaction frames students' opportunities to build identities as capable learners. This dissertation develops a framework leveraging insights from sociocultural and poststructural theory to trace the impact of racialized classroom episodes on students' identity formation. It highlights critical issues that need to be taken into account in the design of equitable learning environments, especially for students of color from persistently marginalized backgrounds.

However, the usual approach treats complex functions as an algebraic shortcut, neglecting geometrical representations of those functions and discarding imaginary parts. This article emphasizes the benefit of using diagrams in the complex plane for such systems, in order to build intuition about harmonic motion and promote spatial reasoning and the use of varied representations. Examples include the analysis of exact time sequences of various kinematic events in damped harmonic motion, sense-making about the phase difference between a driving force and the resulting motion, and understanding the discrepancy between the resonant frequency and the natural undamped frequency for forced, damped harmonic motion. The approach is suitable for supporting instruction in undergraduate upper-division classical mechanics.},

These correlations remained moderate to large when we controlled for length of response. Machine scores exhibited internal consistency, which we view as a measure of reliability. Finally, correlations between machine scores and another measure of teacher knowledge were close in size to those observed for human scores, providing further evidence for the validity of machine scores.

  abstract = {Protein molecules, those objects of increasing interest and investment in post-genomics research, are complex, three-dimensional structures made up of thousands of atoms. Protein crystallographers build atomic-resolution models of proteins using the techniques of X-ray diffraction. This ethnographic study of protein crystallography shows that becoming an expert crystallographer, and so making sense of such intricate objects, requires researchers to draw on their bodies as a resource to learn about, work with, and communicate precise molecular configurations. Contemporary crystallographic modeling relies intensively on interactive computer graphics technology, and requires active and prolonged handling and manipulation of the model onscreen throughout the often arduous process of model-building. This paper builds on both ethnographic observations of contemporary protein crystallographers and historical accounts of early molecular modeling techniques to examine the body-work of crystallographic modeling, in particular the corporeal practices through which modelers learn the intricate structures of protein molecules. Ethnographic observations suggest that, in the process of building and manipulating protein models, crystallographers also sculpt embodied models alongside the digital renderings they craft onscreen. Crystallographic modeling at the computer interface is thus not only a means of producing representations of proteins; it is also a means of training novice crystallographers' bodies and imaginations. Protein crystallographers' molecular embodiments thus offer a site for posing a new range of questions for studies of the visual cultures and knowledge practices in the computer-mediated life sciences.},

We have found that students can be motivated to learn programming and computer science concepts in order to analyze DNA, predict the outcome of elections, detect fraudulent data, suggest friends in a social network, determine the authorship of documents, and more. The approach is more than just a collection of "nifty assignments"; rather, it affects the choice of topics and pedagogy. This paper describes how our approach has been used at four diverse colleges and universities to teach CS majors and non-majors alike. It outlines the types of assignments, which are based on problems from science, engineering, business, and the humanities. Finally, it offers advice for anyone trying to integrate the approach into their own institution.},

  abstract = {An important class of economic models involve agents whose wealth changes due to transactions with other agents. Several authors have pointed out an analogy with kinetic theory, which describes molecules whose momentum and energy changes due to interactions with other molecules. We pursue this analogy and derive a Boltzmann equation for the time evolution of the wealth distribution of a population of agents for the so-called Yard-Sale Model of wealth exchange. We examine the solutions to this equation by a combination of analytical and numerical methods, and investigate its long-time limit. We study an important limit of this equation for small transaction sizes, and derive a partial integrodifferential equation governing the evolution of the wealth distribution in a closed economy. We then describe how this model may be extended to include features such as inflation, production and taxation. In particular, we show that the model with taxation is capable of explaining the basic features of the Pareto law, namely a lower cutoff to the wealth density at small values of wealth, and approximate power-law behavior at large values of wealth.},

In particular, in the theory of computation and complexity (TCC), mapping and polynomial reductions are used for analysis of decidability and computational complexity of problems, including the core concept of NP-completeness. Reduction is a highly abstract technique that involves revealing close non-trivial connections between problems that often seem to have nothing in common. As a result, proper understanding and application of reduction is a serious challenge for students and a source of numerous misconceptions. The main contribution of this paper is detection of such misconceptions, analysis of their roots, and proposing a way to address them in an undergraduate TCC course. Our observations suggest that the main source of the misconceptions is the false intuitive rule ``the bigger is a set/problem, the harder it is to solve''. Accordingly, we developed a series of exercises for proactive prevention of these misconceptions.},

  abstract = {Most accounts of affect and motivation in the science education literature have discussed them as relevant to, but distinct from, disciplinary pursuits. These include Pintrich's seminal work on affective and motivational factors in learning science (P. R. Pintrich, 1999, 2003; P. R. Pintrich \& E. De Groot, 1990; P. R. Pintrich, R. W. Marx, \& R. A. Boyle, 1993). Our purpose here is to build on those ideas, drawing as well on accounts of scientists' practices (e.g., H. E. Gruber, 1974; E. F. Keller, 1983) and of students' taking up of disciplinary pursuits (R. A. Engle \& F. R. Conant, 2002; R. Lehrer, 2009; M. Scardamalia \& C. Bereiter, 1991, 2006) to propose that affect and motivation are inherent in the disciplinary practices of science. Thus, we introduce notions of epistemic affect and epistemic motivation, and we illustrate how these are evident in a case study of a student we have followed from 4th to 7th grade. We consider how this perspective aligns with and contributes to research on interest (e.g., S. Hidi, 2006; S. Hidi, K. A. Renninger, \& A. Krapp, 2004; C. Sansone, 2009), and we discuss implications for research and instruction in science education. We argue that part of what should happen in the science class is to cultivate students' feelings and motivations within the discipline.},

A second model is analytic and deals with compartmented space. A final section applies the analytics to `neighborhood tipping.' The systemic effects are found to be overwhelming: there is no simple correspondence of individual incentive to collective results. Exaggerated separation and patterning result from the dynamics of movement. Inferences about individual motives can usually not be drawn from aggregate patterns. Some unexpected phenomena, like density and vacancy, are generated. A general theory of `tipping' begins to emerge.},

  abstract = {Context/Motivation: Developers make many important decisions as they address given requirements during system design. Each decision is explained and justified by decision-related knowledge. Typically, this knowledge is neither captured in a structured way, nor linked to the respective requirements in detail. Then, it is not obvious, how design decisions realize the given requirements and whether they further refine or shape them. Thus, the relations and alignment of requirements and design cannot be assessed properly. Problem/Question: While there are several studies on decision-making in general, there does not exist a study uncovering how decision-related knowledge emerges based on requirements. Such a study is important to understand the intertwined relations of requirements and design decisions as well as how requirement descriptions could be enhanced with feedback from design decision-making. Principal Idea/Results: We applied a flexible documentation approach for decision-related knowledge on discussion transcripts of two design sessions with professional designers. We analyzed the discussions for decision-related knowledge and documented it together with its relations to the given requirements. Several complex and incrementally growing knowledge structures for decisions were found to emerge in relation to the given requirements. Also, we uncovered that decision-related knowledge contained uncertainties about requirements and further refined them. Contribution: Our study uncovers detailed relations between requirements and design decisions and thereby improves the understanding of their mutual impact on each other. We also derive recommendations for the cooperation between requirements engineers and designers in practice. In addition, we demonstrate that our documentation approach for decision-related knowledge provides a comprehensive view on decisions and their relations to requirements.},

  abstract = {Mental models are mental representations of how an action changes a problem state. Creating a mental model early in the learning process is a strong predictor of success in computer science classes. One major problem in computer science education, however, is that novices have difficulty creating mental models perhaps because of the cognitive overload caused by traditional teaching methods. The present study employed subgoal-labeled instructional materials to promote the creation of mental models when teaching novices to program in Android App Inventor. Utilizing this and other well-established educational tools, such as scaffolding, to reduce cognitive load in computer science education improved the performance of participants on novel tasks when learning to develop mobile applications.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the two-dimensional cutting/packing problem with items that correspond to simple polygons that may contain holes are studied in which we propose algorithms based on no-fit polygon computation. We present a GRASP based heuristic for the 0/1 version of the knapsack problem, and another heuristic for the unconstrained version of the knapsack problem. This last heuristic is divided in two steps: first it packs items in rectangles and then use the rectangles as items to be packed into the bin. We also solve the cutting stock problem with items of irregular shape, by combining this last heuristic with a column generation algorithm. The algorithms proposed found optimal solutions for several of the tested instances within a reasonable runtime. For some instances, the algorithms obtained solutions with occupancy rates above 90\% with relatively fast execution time.},

While this syntax barrier is known to exist, whether and how it varies across programming languages has not been carefully investigated. For this article, we conducted four empirical studies on programming language syntax as part of a larger analysis into the, so called, programming language wars. We first present two surveys conducted with students on the intuitiveness of syntax, which we used to garner formative clues on what words and symbols might be easy for novices to understand. We followed up with two studies on the accuracy rates of novices using a total of six programming languages: Ruby, Java, Perl, Python, Randomo, and Quorum. Randomo was designed by randomly choosing some keywords from the ASCII table (a metaphorical placebo). To our surprise, we found that languages using a more traditional C-style syntax (both Perl and Java) did not afford accuracy rates significantly higher than a language with randomly generated keywords, but that languages which deviate (Quorum, Python, and Ruby) did. These results, including the specifics of syntax that are particularly problematic for novices, may help teachers of introductory programming courses in choosing appropriate first languages and in helping students to overcome the challenges they face with syntax.},

In phase 1 of testing, we explored how children socially interacted to develop design goals when the game lacked explicit guidance about what to do. In phase 2, which we discuss here, we iterated the prototype with partially worked examples to offer more explicit guidance to children.

This cross-case analysis study examined the supports that two students with disabilities, who were initially disengaged during computing activities, received during computing instruction. Data revealed that students' support needs during computing activities were not CT-specific. Rather, supports specific to these students' needs that were successful in other educational areas were also successful and sufficient in CT. Although additional studies would need to be conducted to ascertain the transferability of these findings to other contexts and students, our results contribute evidence that students with disabilities can and should participate in CT and be provided with the supports they need, just as in all other areas of the curriculum. We present a framework for evaluating student engagement to identify student-specific supports and, when needed, refine the emerging K-12 CT pedagogy to facilitate full participation of all students. We then offer a list of four implications for practice based on the findings.},

  abstract = {Modeling is a major topic of interest in mathematics education. However, the field's definition of models is diverse. Less is known about what teachers identify as mathematical models, even though it is teachers who ultimately enact modeling activities in the classroom. In this study, we asked nine middle school teachers with a variety of academic backgrounds and teaching experience to collect data related to one familiar physical phenomenon, cooling liquid. We then asked each participant to construct a model of that phenomenon, describe why it was a model, and identify whether a variety of artifacts representing the phenomenon also counted as models during a semi-structured interview. We sought to identify: what do mathematics teachers attend to when describing what constitutes a model? And, how do their attentions shift as they engage in different activities related to models? Using content analysis, we documented what features and purposes teachers attended to when describing a mathematical model. When constructing their own model, they focused on the visual form of the model and what quantitative information it should include. When deciding whether particular representational artifacts constituted models, they focused on how the representations reflected the system under study, and what purposes those representations could serve in further understanding that system. These findings suggest teachers may have multiple understandings of models, which are active at different times and reflect different perspectives. This has implications for research, teacher education, and professional development.},

In typical biology instruction, these levels have been segregated. Yet, it is by examining the connections between such levels that many phenomena in biology, and complex systems in general, are best explained. We describe a computation-based approach that enables students to investigate the connections between different biological levels. Using agent-based, embodied modeling tools, students model the microrules underlying a biological phenomenon and observe the resultant aggregate dynamics. We describe 2 cases in which this approach was used. In both cases, students framed hypotheses, constructed multiagent models that incorporate these hypotheses, and tested these by running their models and observing the outcomes. Contrasting these cases against traditionally used, classical equation-based approaches, we argue that the embodied modeling approach connects more directly to students' experience, enables extended investigations as well as deeper understanding, and enables "advanced" topics to be productively introduced into the high school curriculum.},

  abstract = {Modeling is a major topic of interest in mathematics education. However, the field's definition of models is diverse. Less is known about what teachers identify as mathematical models, even though it is teachers who ultimately enact modeling activities in the classroom. In this study, we asked nine middle school teachers with a variety of academic backgrounds and teaching experience to collect data related to one familiar physical phenomenon, cooling liquid. We then asked each participant to construct a model of that phenomenon, describe why it was a model, and identify whether a variety of artifacts representing the phenomenon also counted as models during a semi-structured interview. We sought to identify: what do mathematics teachers attend to when describing what constitutes a model? And, how do their attentions shift as they engage in different activities related to models? Using content analysis, we documented what features and purposes teachers attended to when describing a mathematical model. When constructing their own model, they focused on the visual form of the model and what quantitative information it should include. When deciding whether particular representational artifacts constituted models, they focused on how the representations reflected the system under study, and what purposes those representations could serve in further understanding that system. These findings suggest teachers may have multiple understandings of models, which are active at different times and reflect different perspectives. This has implications for research, teacher education, and professional development.},

Initial attempts at classroom gamification relied on the teacher manually tracking student progress. At the US Air Force Academy, we wanted to experiment with a software gamification tool. Our client/server suite, dubbed Classroom Live, streamlines the gamification process for the teacher by simplifying common tasks. Simultaneously, the tool provides students with an esthetically pleasing user interface that offers in game rewards in exchange for their participation. Classroom Live is still in development, but our initial experience using the tool has been extremely positive and confirms our belief that students respond positively to gamification, even at the undergraduate level.},

By analogy with the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution of energy in physics, it is shown that the probability distribution of money is exponential for certain classes of models with interacting economic agents. Alternative scenarios are also reviewed. Data analysis of the empirical distributions of wealth and income reveals a two-class distribution. The majority of the population belongs to the lower class, characterized by the exponential (``thermal'') distribution, whereas a small fraction of the population in the upper class is characterized by the power-law (``superthermal'') distribution. The lower part is very stable, stationary in time, whereas the upper part is highly dynamical and out of equilibrium.},

Grounded in the autoethnographic investigation of a grassroots organization's design of a local campaign, the author traces the successive transformations of design artifacts, delineating a narrative character to design within grassroots spaces. One major lesson is that centering the question of participation is not just about including historically marginalized peoples at the core of design; it has the potential to ``desettle'' projects at a fundamental level, challenging dominant epistemologies that inform the practices of learning scientists, and thus transforming the field in ways that have yet to be systematically explored. More broadly, this study highlights the need for future research on design practices as they take form within understudied spaces, such as grassroots organizations.},

Analytic snapshots illustrate these developed concepts, evincing how teenagers actively affect place and belonging over time in an informal digital media and learning program, Metro Building Blocks. The article concludes calling for developed theories of correspondence in order to better attune method to understanding how bodies generate feelings of belonging and to how bodies actively maintain this sense of belonging through emergent, affective practice.},

Using the notion of politicized trust as a conceptual lens, we reflect on two distinct participatory design projects to explore how political and racial solidarity was established, contested, and negotiated throughout the course of the design process. Ultimately, this article argues that making visible how race and power mediate relationships in design research is critical for engaging in ethical and sociopolitically conscious relationships with community partners and developing theoretical and practical knowledge about the repertoires of practice, tasks, and sociocultural competencies demanded of university researchers.},

We asked: What will aid families in advocating for their children's math learning, particularly when they expressed concern about their ability to do so? Participatory design research provided a collaborative and iterative method to work with people who shape math learning: parents, children, teachers, community organizers, researchers, curriculum developers, and mathematicians. Data from four years of participant observation involved the design, facilitation, and dissemination of workshops and take-home materials and family case studies. As participating families claimed epistemic authority, institutional barriers became more visible. This tension maps where participatory design methodology can evolve to address systemic change.},

Drawing on cultural historical activity theory, decolonizing methodologies, and indigenous perspectives, these articles seek to advance participatory design research as a means to foreground the development of socially just systems with equitable forms of teaching and learning. Specifically, the ``social change making'' projects exemplified reflect a generational and hybrid shift in design approaches, incorporating political and innovative dimensions of other methods with shared aims. A notable focus of participatory design research is that design and interventions are understood and addressed as part of everyday activity. In this way, change making projects are conceptualized from within the practices and commitments, and histories of communities. These new sensibilities about working with nondominant communities necessarily involve rethinking and explicitly redesigning the research and participants. subject positions across all aspects of the intervention. Finally, these emergent participatory design research projects argue that issues of race, equity, and inequality are neither sufficiently theorized or addressed by other theoretical approaches, including cultural activity theoretical approaches.},

I aim to present an argument that queer theory supports investigation of a range of educational issues\textemdash{}particularly those that are linked to sexual and gendered norms and identities\textemdash{}and that participatory design research is particularly well suited to queered approaches to theorizing, designing, and investigating learning. I then offer principles for queering participatory design, drawing on data collected during a recent design study completed in an elementary classroom. Finally, I discuss the implications of a queered approach to participatory design.},

Learning communities consist of conventionally separate groups of students that meet together with common academic purposes and goals. Types of learning communities include paired courses with concurrent student enrollment, living-learning communities, and faculty learning communities. This article discusses a learning community of 21 students that I created with a colleague in the English department. The community encompasses two general education courses: an algebra-based physics course entitled ``Intro to Physics'' and a literature course entitled ``Science Fiction, Science Fact.'' Students must enroll in both of these courses during the same semester. Additionally, I highlight advantages to linking these courses through surveying the assignments and course materials that we used in our learning community. Figure 1 shows the topics that are covered in both physics and literature courses.},

The term ``agent'' in the context of ABMs indicates individual computational objects or actors that obey simple rules assigned or controlled by the user. It is the interactions between these agents that give rise to emergent, aggregate-level behaviors in complex systems. While several researchers have argued for the effectiveness of ABMs for learning about complex systems, the design of classroom activity systems using ABMs, especially for elementary students, has received relatively less attention. In this paper, we report on a 2-week long proof-of-concept study conducted in a third-grade classroom of 15 students in which students began with an embodied modeling activity of foraging behavior, followed with the generation of mathematical inscriptions based on their embodied actions, and finally, conducted further inquiry of interdependence in an ecosystem using two separate ABMs. Furthermore, we show that the lens of mechanistic reasoning can be productively used to identify the process of students' conceptual development of interdependence in an ecosystem as they engage in the modeling activities.},

However, it is still an open question whether highly interactive, 3D geographic data browsing, and visualization displays support effective and efficient spatio-temporal decision making. Moreover, little is known about the role of time constraints for spatio-temporal decision-making in an interactive, 3D context. In this article, we present an empirical approach to assess the effect of decision-time constraints on the quality of spatio-temporal decision-making when using 3D geo-browsers, such as GoogleEarth, in 3D task contexts of varying complexity. Our experimental results suggest that while, overall, people interact more with interactive geo-browsers when not under time pressure, this does not mean that they are also more accurate or more confident in their decisions when solving typical 3D cartometric tasks. Surprisingly, we also find that 2D interaction capabilities (i.e., zooming and panning) are more frequently used for 3D tasks than 3D interaction tools (i.e., rotating and tilting), regardless of time pressure. Finally, we find that background and training of tested users do not seem to influence 3D task performance. In summary, our study does not provide any evidence for the added value of using interactive 3D globe viewers when needing to solve 3D cartometric tasks with or without time pressure.},

  abstract = {Developing a visual hierarchy in map displays that is congruent with thematic levels of relevance is a fundamental cartographic design task. Cartographers employ a set of visual variables (e.g., size, color hue, color value, orientation, etc.) for 2-D, static maps to systematically match levels of thematically relevant information to a perceptual hierarchy based on figure\textendash{}ground relationships. In this article, we empirically investigate the relationship of thematic relevance and perceptual salience in static weather map displays. We are particularly interested in how novices' viewing patterns are modified when thematically relevant items are made perceptually more salient through design. In essence, we are asking whether perceptually salient elements draw novice viewers' attention to thematically relevant information, whether or not users have domain knowledge. In a factorial experiment, we ask novice participants to evaluate the wind direction in weather maps before and after training all participants on meteorological principles. Our empirical results suggest that display design (i.e., saliency) does not influence the accuracy of response, whether participants have prior knowledge or not (i.e., training). Analysis of the eye-movement patterns, however, suggests that display design does affect viewing behavior and response time. These findings provide rare empirical evidence for generally accepted design practices within the cartographic community (e.g., the effects of visual variables). We chose weather map displays as one typical example of commonly used maps for our study, but the methods employed are generic enough to be applicable to any spatial display (static or interactive) that might be produced by GIScientists, cartographers, geographic information system (GIS) practitioners, and others.},

  abstract = {Map-making has traditionally been the domain of professional cartographers, but with the advent of interactive display systems, users now have the flexibility to create and configure their own digital maps and other visual displays. This flexibility can be beneficial only if users have good intuitions about which display configurations are effective or ineffective for different tasks. Here we examine people's intuitions about display effectiveness and whether these intuitions match the actual effectiveness of different displays. Surveys of undergraduate students and post-graduate meteorology students reveal that they consistently prefer enhanced displays, especially those that add animation and realism. These na{\"\i}ve intuitions contrast with the principles of cartography, which emphasize the importance of abstracting from the real world to create simple displays that make task-relevant information salient. Both a review of objective studies and a new study presented here support traditional principles of cartography and are inconsistent with na{\"\i}ve intuitions. We interpret these studies in relation to new theoretical notions of users' folk fallacies about how perception works, and derive implications for the design of interactive display systems and education.},

  abstract = {Research on practices to share and reuse data will inform the design of infrastructure to support data collection, management, and discovery in the long tail of science and technology. These are research domains in which data tend to be local in character, minimally structured, and minimally documented. We report on a ten-year study of the Center for Embedded Network Sensing (CENS), a National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center. We found that CENS researchers are willing to share their data, but few are asked to do so, and in only a few domain areas do their funders or journals require them to deposit data. Few repositories exist to accept data in CENS research areas.. Data sharing tends to occur only through interpersonal exchanges. CENS researchers obtain data from repositories, and occasionally from registries and individuals, to provide context, calibration, or other forms of background for their studies. Neither CENS researchers nor those who request access to CENS data appear to use external data for primary research questions or for replication of studies. CENS researchers are willing to share data if they receive credit and retain first rights to publish their results. Practices of releasing, sharing, and reusing of data in CENS reaffirm the gift culture of scholarship, in which goods are bartered between trusted colleagues rather than treated as commodities.},

First, I demonstrate how the invention of representational forms by individuals occur as part of a larger social process of creating cultural conventions and negotiating a taken-as-shared understanding of these new tools. Second, I show how gesture, as a part of the larger semiotic ecology for meaning making around representations, contributes to creation of understanding. Third, I make some preliminary proposals regarding the process of transforming personal inventions into cultural conventions. The analyses are intended to contribute to our field's growing understanding of young children's activity when inventing representations (i.e., metarepresentational competence), the mechanisms for learning within instructional activities based on the iterative refinement of these representations (i.e., progressive symbolization), and a rejection of the dichotomy between an individual's cognition and her participation within a cultural community.},

We present a method for constructing a probabilistic model of color naming from a large, unconstrained set of human color name judgments. We describe how the model can be used to map between colors and names and define metrics for color saliency (how reliably a color is named) and color name distance (the similarity between colors based on naming patterns). We then present a series of applications that demonstrate how color naming models can enhance graphical interfaces: a color dictionary \& thesaurus, name-based pixel selection methods for image editing, and evaluation aids for color palette design.},

Geological maps are complex in particular because 3-dimensional features must be inferred from 2-dimensional representations depicted by differing line types and weights. Modeling building, as an internal mental activity, is also required in order to achieve deep understanding of textual materials in geology, of geological maps, as well as in understanding complex causal processes, e.g., convection, underlying geological phenomena. Using literature from Cognitive Psychology, a framework for teaching and learning with visualizations in Plate Tectonics is given as an example of one difficult topic in Geology which involves the understanding of visualizations. Based on previous work in students' conceptions in Geology, three studies of students' conceptions and cognition in plate tectonics were designed. These studies highlight the importance of progressive model-building as a good pedagogical approach, as well as examine the efficacy of different learning tasks as strategies to promote model-building on the part of learners.},

  abstract = {Visual representations play a critical role in enhancing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning. Educational psychology research shows that adding visual representations to text can enhance students' learning of content knowledge, compared to text-only. But should students learn with a single type of visual representation or with multiple different types of visual representations? This article addresses this question from the perspective of the representation dilemma, namely that students often learn content they do not yet understand from representations they do not yet understand. To benefit from visual representations, students therefore need representational competencies, that is, knowledge about how visual representations depict information about the content. This article reviews literature on representational competencies involved in students' learning of content knowledge. Building on this review, this article analyzes how the number of visual representations affects the role these representational competencies play during students' learning of content knowledge. To this end, the article compares two common scenarios: text plus a single type of visual representations (T+SV) and text plus multiple types of visual representations (T+MV). The comparison yields seven hypotheses that describe under which conditions T+MV scenarios are more effective than T+SV scenarios. Finally, the article reviews empirical evidence for each hypothesis and discusses open questions about the representation dilemma.},

  doi = {10.1002/tea.21379},
  abstract = {Research on the design of learning environments for K-12 science education has been informed by two bodies of literature: inquiry-based science and Constructionism. Inquiry-based science has emphasized engagement in activities that reflect authentic scientific practices. Constructionism has focused on designing intuitively accessible authoring environments and microworlds that embody the structure of a content domain in program code. Learners build, extend, or explore artifacts to make sense of underlying mechanisms. In this paper, we bridge these bodies of work to argue that interacting with program code of a computational model can facilitate engagement in inquiry-based science. Tinkering with code involves students playfully manipulating the code of a computational model to generate and pursue goals or questions in the model. We use data from video-recorded interviews with eleven 10th grade students in which they demonstrate their tinkering explorations with code of models of biological phenomena, and describe related interactions with other students. We analyze these data using a conceptual framework of inquiry-based science consisting of three components: pursuit of investigations, sense making of investigations, and engagement with a community. We characterize points of alignment between students' tinkering and these components to argue that tinkering with code underlying computational models facilitated engagement in inquiry-based science. We also demonstrate how it provided opportunities for disciplinary engagement in two ways: Computational engagement or using code as a representational medium to pursue questions of interest, and conceptual engagement, or coming to notice and explain resulting changes in the modeled phenomenon. More broadly, we argue that the constructionist approach of interacting with and manipulating program code of computational models can facilitate productive forms of engagement with inquiry-based science. We discuss affordances of interacting with code as a way to engage in inquiry, and provide design recommendations for the adoption of manipulation of code as an inquiry practice. \textcopyright{} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {An interactive learning task was designed in a game format to help high school students acquire knowledge about a simple mechanical system involving a car moving on a ramp. This ramp game consisted of five challenges that addressed individual knowledge components with increasing difficulty. In order to investigate patterns of knowledge emergence during the ramp game, we applied the Monte Carlo Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) algorithm to 447 game segments produced by 64 student groups in two physics teachers' classrooms. Results indicate that, in the ramp game context, (1) the initial knowledge and guessing parameters were significantly highly correlated, (2) the slip parameter was interpretable monotonically, (3) low guessing parameter values were associated with knowledge emergence while high guessing parameter values were associated with knowledge maintenance, and (4) the transition parameter showed the speed of knowledge emergence. By applying the k-means clustering to ramp game segments represented in the three dimensional space defined by guessing, slip, and transition parameters, we identified seven clusters of knowledge emergence. We characterize these clusters and discuss implications for future research as well as for instructional game design.},

  doi = {10.1002/sce.20286},
  abstract = {Constructing scientific explanations and participating in argumentative discourse are seen as essential practices of scientific inquiry (e.g., R. Driver, P. Newton, \& J. Osborne, 2000). In this paper, we identify three goals of engaging in these related scientific practices: (1) sensemaking, (2) articulating, and (3) persuading. We propose using these goals to understand student engagement with these practices, and to design instructional interventions to support students. Thus, we use this framework as a lens to investigate the question: What successes and challenges do students face as they engage in the scientific practices of explanation and argumentation? We study this in the context of a curriculum that provides students and teachers with an instructional framework for constructing and defending scientific explanations. Through this analysis, we find that students consistently use evidence to make sense of phenomenon and articulate those understandings but they do not consistently attend to the third goal of persuading others of their understandings. Examining the third goal more closely reveals that persuading others of an understanding requires social interactions that are often inhibited by traditional classroom interactions. Thus, we conclude by proposing design strategies for addressing the social challenges inherent in the related scientific practices of explanation and argumentation. \textcopyright{} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This brings the field into contact with an established body of research on framing, which studies how people form a sense of ``what is it that's going on here?'' (Goffman, E. (1974). Frame analysis: An essay on the organization of experience. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press). That literature depicts framing as a dynamic process that is sensitive to context, occurring within and among individuals through subtle, meta-level messages. We give a brief review of research on framing, including epistemological framing (Redish, E.F. (2004). A theoretical framework for physics education research: Modeling student thinking. In E. F. Redish \& Vicentini (Eds.), Proceedings of the Enrico Fermi Summer School Course, CLVI (pp. 1\textendash{}63).

  volume = {51},
  issn = {1098-2736},
  doi = {10.1002/tea.21147},
  abstract = {Though addressing sources of uncertainty is an important part of doing science, it has largely been neglected in assessing students' scientific argumentation. In this study, we initially defined a scientific argumentation construct in four structural elements consisting of claim, justification, uncertainty qualifier, and uncertainty rationale. We consulted literature to characterize and score different levels of student performances on each of these four argumentation elements. We designed a test comprised of nine scientific argumentation tasks addressing climate change, the search for life in space, and fresh water availability and administered it to 473 students from 9 high schools in the United States. After testing the local dependence and unidimensionality assumptions, we found that the uncertainty qualifier element was not aligned with the other three. After removing items related to uncertainty qualifier, we applied a Rasch analysis based on a Partial Credit Model. Results indicate that (1) claim, justification, and uncertainty rationale items form a unidimensional scale, (2) justification and uncertainty rationale items contribute the most on the unidimensional scientific argumentation scale as they cover much wider ranges of the scale than claim items, (3) average item difficulties increase in the order of claim, justification, and uncertainty rationale, (4) students' elaboration of uncertainty exhibits dual characteristics: self-assessment of their own knowledge and ability versus scientific assessment of conceptual and empirical errors embedded in investigations, and (5) students who can make warrants between theory and evidence are more likely to think about uncertainty from scientific sources than those who cannot. We identified limitations of this study in terms of science topic coverage and sample selection and made suggestions on how these limitations might have affected results and interpretations. \textcopyright{} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

making predictions about complex systems. Since models cannot represent all known and

unknown aspects of how nature operates, claims based on model-based data inevitably contain

uncertainty. This study explores (1) how high school students attribute sources of uncertainty

when prompted as part of an argumentation task and (2) how intelligent feedback may guide

them to become more cognizant about deep uncertainty associated with model-based data.

Phenomenological analyses of students' uncertainty attributions (N = 840) identified five

distinct patterns: self-introspection, personal theories and experiences, data source

acknowledgement, scientific description based on singular causal accounts and frequency of

observations, and deep uncertainty based on epistemic or ontic accounts. Discourse captured

on video illustrated how intelligent feedback enhanced uncertainty attribution. Topic Introduction},
