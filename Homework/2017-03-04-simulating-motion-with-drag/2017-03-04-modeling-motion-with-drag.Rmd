## What you will turn in

A python script (`.py` file) that models dropping a cannonball off the [Washington Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Monument). Your script will need to:

1. Set up a simulation to drop a cannonball off the washington monument.
2. Compute the acceleration in terms of gravity (like we have been doing in class) **but also [account for drag](#accounting-for-drag)**. 
3. Plots a graph of the cannonball's position (y axis) versus time-steps (x-axis).
5. Plots the cannonball's *velocity* (y-axis) versus *time* (x-axis).
4. Answers thes questions: 
    1. At what *time* does the cannonball hit the ground?
    2. How fast is the cannonball going **just before it hits the ground**

## What Your Submission Will (roughly) Look Like

```python
# Import any modules you need

# Set up the quantities you know (height, acceleration due to gravity)

# Set up a DataFrame to collect data on position, velocity, acceleration, and time

# Run The Simulation

## For each timestep:

### Update Acceleration
### Update Velocity
### Update Position
### Append the new quantities to the existing DataFrame

# Plot The Data

## Plot Position vs. Time

## Plot Acceleration Vs. Time

# Answer AND EXPLAIN HOW YOU DETERMINED

## When the cannonball hits the ground
## How fast it's going just before it hits the ground
```

## Drag

### What Is Drag

We're making our model a bit more complex this time by including *drag* (which we also call "air resistance"). Any time you've tried to walk outside, face to the wind, and it's difficult, you're experiencing drag.

An extreme example of drag is that you can go "indoor skydiving", where you put your body over a giant fan. The fan blows hard enough to lift you off the ground, which provides enough air resistance to keep you from falling back to the floor:

### How To Account For Drag in Your Model {.accounting-for-drag}

*Formally*, drag produces a force. As our cannonball falls, the air is gradually going to push back up on it, providing an acceleration that opposes the falling.

The equation we'll use to model drag through air is:

$$ \vec{F}_{\textrm{drag}} = \frac{1}{2}CDA\vec{v}^2$$

| Symbol | What It Stands For                 | Its Numerical Value                                  |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| $C$    | Coefficient of Drag                | 1 (for a sphere)                                     |
| $D$    | Density of the Fluid               | 1.184 $\textrm{kg}/\textrm{m}^3$ for air at $25^{o}\textrm{C}$ |
| $A$    | Cross-Sectional Area of the Object | $1\textrm{m}^2$ (it's a huge cannonball)        |
| $v$    | velocity of the cannonball         | 0, initially                                         |

#### Assume 

- The cannonball is pure iron 
- The density of iron is $7874\textrm{kg} / \textrm{m}^3$
- The cannonball has a $1\textrm{m}^2$ cross-sectional area 

You'll need to do some math to figure out the acceleration on the cannonball at any instant in time. Remember:

$$ \vec{a}_\textrm{cannon ball} = \frac{\vec{F}_\textrm{drag}}{m_\textrm{cannon ball}} + \left(\textrm{acceleration due to gravity}\right) $$

And also remember that the force (and acceleration) of drag works against the acceleration due to gravity. *Drag slows our cannonball*.
