# What you will turn in

A text document where you identify and describe **3** datasets.

## For each dataset

1. Paste a link to the data
2. Write at least one paragraph about how you found the data and what its structure is. (What columns are there? What kinds of values are in those columns?)
3. Write at least one paragraph describing why you're interested in it and what questions you would like to explore
