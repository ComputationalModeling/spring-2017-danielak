# End-of-semester reflection (Due April 28, 2017)

## What you will turn in

You have multiple options for what to turn in; **choose one**:

1. The screenplay of a 3-minute trailer for this class (as a text or document file)
2. The audio/video from someone interviewing you for about 4 minutes (as an audio/video recording file)
3. An alternate format you work out with me if none of these options work for you

### Trailer screenplay option (3--5 pages)

Imagine there is a 3-minute [movie trailer](http://trailers.apple.com/) for CMSE 201. You get to write the screenplay for this trailer. I suggest watching a few trailers (especially if you've never done it) to get a taste of what they're like. Here are some helpful references:

- A mashup of common elements in classic movie trailers: https://youtu.be/PjWKE-IJ4R8
- The trailer for _The Comedian_, which makes fun of all the common tropes in trailers: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVDzuT0fXro
- Here's an example short screenplay. It's not perfect, but it is three pages: https://johnaugust.com/Assets/FosdikeMorgan.pdf

### Interview Option (4--5 minute interview)

Have someone you know interview you about experiences in this class. If you have a smartphone, odds are good it has a way to record audio. (iPhones have an app called Voice Memos, for example). 

Try to aim for an interview that lasts about 4 minutes: long enough to say something substantial, short enough for a news segment. We encourage you to be creative, but also be yourself. 

#### Some sample interview questions

- If you could go back in time to the beginning of the semester and talk to past-you, what would you say? What advice would you give? Try to be as specific as you can be.
- Imagine you have a friend—let's call them D—who's a professional engineer. D wants to sit it on this class to learn about Computational modeling for their job, but they're not taking the class for credit, so *grades don't matter.* What advice would you have for D about how to approach this course?
- Do you plan to take 202---the continuation of this course? Why, or why not?
- Do any of your experiences of this course stand out as surprising to you? If so, which parts and why?
