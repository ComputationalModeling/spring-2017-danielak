Lower your hand if you:

- Are or were in Marching Band

- Play games competitively (chess, magic the gathering)
- Have been a musician (vocal, instrumental, electronic)
- Have learned to drive
- Have learned a new language

### Metacognition: Thinking about thinking

> I inform the students that I reserve the right to ask them the following questions at any time during their problem solving:
>
> - What (exactly) are you doing? (Can you describe it precisely?)
> - Why are you doing it? (How does it fit into the solution?)
> - How does it help you? (What will you do with the outcome when you ubtain it?)
>
> About 2 weeks into the course, I start asking the small groups these questions as I move through the room in my role as problem-solving consultant. (Schoenfeld, 1987, p. 206)
