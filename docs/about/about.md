## About Me:

I graduated the <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/" target="_blank">University at Buffalo</a> <a href="http://honors.buffalo.edu/" target="_blank">Honors Program</a>, with degrees in Chemistry (BA, 2007) and English (BA, 2007). While there, I worked as an undergraduate research fellow with <a href="http://www.chemistry.buffalo.edu/people/faculty/takeuchik/" target="_blank">Kenneth Takeuchi</a>. I also completed an Undergraduate Honors Thesis on the relationships between narrative and science under the direction of <a href="http://english.buffalo.edu/faculty/faculty/daly/" target="_blank">Robert Daly</a>.

I&#8217;m currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in <a href="http://www.education.umd.edu/EDCI/info/scigrad.html" target="_blank">Science Education Research</a> at the [University of Maryland](http://www.umd.edu). At the moment, I study how university [engineering students engage in mathematical and physical sensemaking](http://umdperg.pbworks.com/Engineering-Education-Project) in their courses. I work under [Ayush Gupta](http://umdperg.pbworks.com/Ayush+Gupta), and my advisor [Andy Elby](http://www2.physics.umd.edu/~elby/).

## Research Interests:

  * Mathematical sensemaking and symbolic reasoning
  * Representational competency in scientific argumentation
  * Students&#8217; epistemological beliefs in science and mathematics
  * Interplays of emotion, cognition, and student epistemology

## Currently Working On:

  * [Engineers&#8217; Mathematical Sensemaking](http://umdperg.pbworks.com/Engineering-Education-Project)
  * Ph.D. Comprehensive Exams
