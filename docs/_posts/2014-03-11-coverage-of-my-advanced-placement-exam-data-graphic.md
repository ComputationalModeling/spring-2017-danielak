In a [previous post](http://briandk.com/2014/01/creating-a-better-data-graphic-for-advanced-placement-exam-data/) I took a crack at re-visualizing data from high school Advanced Placement (AP) exams. I&#8217;m interested in the dataset because of what it shows about students&#8217; participation in science, technology, mathematics, and engineering (STEM) subjects. But, I took a particular interest in how some outlets were representing the ratios of males to females who take the exam.<sup id="fnref-91-gender"><a href="#fn-91-gender" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>

[![My revised graphic of the AP exam data](https://raw.github.com/briandk/ap-exam-data/master/ap-exam-data.png "My revised graphic of the AP exam data (Click to Embiggen)")](https://raw.github.com/briandk/ap-exam-data/master/ap-exam-data.png "My revised graphic of the AP exam data (Click to Embiggen)")

I&#8217;m thrilled to find people are circulating [my revised graphic](https://raw.github.com/briandk/ap-exam-data/master/ap-exam-data.png). For example, [Mark Guzdial](http://computinged.wordpress.com) used it in a post on his blog for the Communications of the ACM. There, he noted that not only does the graphic give a better sense of the gender ratios for all exams, it also reviews the overall low participation in AP Computer Science exams, shown by their small dot size.

I&#8217;m also excited to say that my graphic will be featured on the [Visions of Science](http://visionsofscience.tv/) Vodcast. Visions of Science is a web video series focused on how scientific images convey meaning and aid understanding. The show is made possible through the generous support of [The Association for the Cooperative Advancement of Science Education (ACASE)](http://www.acase.org/), and I hope you&#8217;ll check it out once our episode goes live!

  I&#8217;m trying to be careful here to use the terminology afforded by the data, in this case, &#8220;male&#8221; and &#8220;female.&#8221; For me, both personally and research-wise, biological sex and gender are substantially and consequentially different. I&#8217;ll leave my fuller views on gender out here, and suffice it to say that in general, I think <a href="http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2010/11/26/disalienation/">gender is a text-field</a>, not a binary radio button.&#160;<a href="#fnref-91-gender" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a> </fn></footnotes>
