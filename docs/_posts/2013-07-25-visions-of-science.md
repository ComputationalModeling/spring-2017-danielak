We want you to help us with an experiment. My friends and I are starting up a video podcast on visualizations in science. We think of ourselves as [Robert Krulwich](http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/)&#8216;s geeky, inquisitive extended family. But, we&#8217;re the weird branch that&#8217;s super-obsessed with visualizations. In each episode we&#8217;ll feature experts in science and representational domains having conversations with us.

## Our aims are to:

  * Disseminate powerful scientific visualizations to wider audiences
  * Promote the public&#8217;s understanding of scientific representations
  * Provide existing research projects a venue for engaging broadly with the public
  * Showcase positive, diverse role models for people considering careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) fields

We made a (very rough) proof-of-concept episode that we want to share with you. And, with your support (see [our survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1eU9dqSzkteotHMJ5h8JzOo3goK0pGIw1Zdv9prFu4OM/viewform) we might be able to turn this into a professional reality).

## In this episode, we discuss:

  * [Introductions (00:02)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lelKvmzGQ8M&t=0m2s)
  * [We thank NASA for space, and dropping golf carts from 35,000 feet (01:12)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lelKvmzGQ8M&t=1m12s)
  * [We thank the Gordon Research Conference Series in Visualization (02:46)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lelKvmzGQ8M&t=2m46s)
  * [Exploring the molecular structure of Golgi bodies in yeast cells (06:19)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lelKvmzGQ8M&t=6m19s)
  * [Network visualizations of pandemics (17:45)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lelKvmzGQ8M&t=17m45s)
  * [Thank-yous and Goodbyes (26:38)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lelKvmzGQ8M&t=26m38s)

# Things you should know before watching

  1. **This was our first time. It&#8217;s a rough draft, it&#8217;s unedited, and there are ragged edges.**
  2. We only had one hour to write, produce, record, and post this entire show. Imagine what we could do with more practice.
  3. Actual shows will never be this long (28 mins), but we wanted to illustrate different types of segments.
  4. With your help (_[by filling out the survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1eU9dqSzkteotHMJ5h8JzOo3goK0pGIw1Zdv9prFu4OM/viewform)_) we may be able to secure grant funding to get professional equipment and make high-quality future shows a reality.

Please take our work in the spirit of a start, not a final product <img src="http://i0.wp.com/BrianDK.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png?w=840" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" data-recalc-dims="1" />
