    <h1 class="post-title">Beginning work on epistemological dynamics in programming</h1>
    <span class="post-date">02 Aug 2011</span>
    <p>I’m preparing for my comprehensive examinations (comps), which are essentially three in-depth essays written and revised under the direction of a faculty member. My second comp is actually my work on a statistical graphics package called <a href="https://github.com/briandk/granova">granova</a>, but I’ll be discussing that subject in another post. Here, I want to talk about my third comp, which will hopefully become the springboard to a dissertation proposal.</p>

<p>If I’m doing my job right, this post will grow into a much larger series of posts, and hopefully (when well-watered, cared for, and nourished) a dissertation. To get there, here are some of the core questions I think I’ll need to address.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>What are epistemological dynamics?</strong> What do I mean when I’m talking about epistemologies and epistemological dynamics? What does that idea do as a technical construct?</li>
  <li><strong>Where do epistemological dynamics come from?</strong> What’s their genesis as a research construct? More to the point, what do they allow us to explain and predict?</li>
  <li><strong>Why do epistemological dynamics matter for learning to program?</strong> This has to go beyond simply arguing that “they matter.” Many, many things affect the ways individuals learn to program. The subquestions here surround how we can <em>use</em> the study of epistemological dynamics in programming?
    <ol>
      <li>Can they push research efforts forward, illuminating erstwhile unseen problems?</li>
      <li>Can they push the theoretical discussion forward, explaining the otherwise un- or underexplained?</li>
      <li>Finally, can they inform pedagogy? Can epistemological dynamics help us craft educational experiences around programming that attract, retain, and empower students?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>As part of my work preparing for the <a href="http://wp.acm.org/icer-conference/about/">2011 International Computing Education Research Conference</a> (ICER), I’ll be working through a presentation that tries to flesh out these issues. The goal there is to craft a form of these dissertation ideas that conference attendees can critique. Keep your eyes on the blog as I continue to expand my ideas and hopefully tackle—or refine—the above roadmap of questions.</p>
