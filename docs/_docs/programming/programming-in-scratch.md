On our third day of class (18 Jan 2017) we'll be starting to learn in a programming environment called [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu).

![Scratch Running in Google's Chrome Web Browser](http://d.pr/i/7Mhc+)

We'll be using Scratch inside a web browser, but it requires the [Adobe Flash Player](https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/). Read on for how to get set up.

## How to Prepare for Class

You're all set. Windows 10 has the Microsoft Edge browser has Flash installed.

#### If you aren't on Windows 10 and don't use Chrome
