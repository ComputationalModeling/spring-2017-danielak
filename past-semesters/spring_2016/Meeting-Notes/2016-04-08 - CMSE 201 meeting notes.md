> I've seen different students do this, where in iPython Notebooks they just have one cell, and all the code goes in one cell. On one hand, that undermines a lot of what iPython Notebook is good. On the other hand, it's brilliant because they're adopting a method that helps tame the complexity/confusion of dealing with a multi-cell notebook.
