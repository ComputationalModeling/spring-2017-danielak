# Grading rubric for Homework 5

This assignment is worth 100 points (scaled to whatever is in the grade book).  The goal of this homework assignment was to use the "bag of words" model on all of the candidates' tweets in the 2016 presidential elections. 


**General guidelines:** I'm providing point totals at a relatively coarse level - subdivide/give partial credit as necessary.  Unlike homework 4, this homework is pretty tightly proscribed, so we aren't as worried about having the students write well-structured code, though we expect them to use functions and add comments as appropriate.

Step 1 (download data): 5 points

Step 2 (create a tweetcount function): 15 points - this one must be a function!

* 10 pts; code correctness
* 2 pts; is it actually a function?
* 3 pts; comments in code to explain what's going on?

Step 3: (new version of tweetcount function.): 15 points.  Is it actually fixed?  Same breakdown as above, but -5 points if they went ahead and made the changes in-place in the original function.

Step 4: (Total Average Tweet): 5 points. 

Step 5: (loop over twitter names): 5 points

Step 6: (bar graph of candidates): 5 points.  Use your judgment here - take off 1 point each if they don't have: x and y labels, bar labeled w/each candidate's name (this adds up to more than 5 points; minimum of zero points)

Question 1: 5 points (coarsely graded; if they have two or more search term examples, they get full points.  If they have one example, they get 2 points for not trying.  If they have none, zero points.)

Question 2: 5 points (but we forgot to remove the solutions, so it's a freebie)

Question 3: 10 points. As long as they give a thoughtful answer, grade generously!

Question 4: 5 points. As long as they give a thoughtful answer, grade generously!

Question 5: 20 points.  This is pretty free-form, and we're asking the students to go out on a limb.  Use your best judgment, but maybe look at several of the students' answers before you assign points here.  As long as they've done *something* and it's kind of interesting, give it to them.  But, I would like to see the best few answers!

Question 6: 5 points.  As long as they give a thoughtful answer, grade generously!

Feedback: No points awarded, but take off 5 points if they don't answer the "how much time did you spend" question.
