# Grading rubric for Homework 7

This assignment is worth 100 points (scaled to whatever is in the grade book).  The goal of this homework assignment was to use numerical integration to calculate the 2D motion of launched objects using air resistance.

**General guidelines:** I'm providing point totals at a relatively coarse level - subdivide/give partial credit as necessary.  We expect students to use functions and add comments as appropriate.

## Section 1 - The Model

This section is a total of 50 points.

30 points: Code itself. Look for appropriate treatment of a few things in particular:

* are sensible assumptions made about how to move?  (stepping into adjacent cells rather than random placement)
* is the function that calculates reproduction written correctly?
* Is the function or functions that removes deer written correctly?

10 points: Did they use functions, as requested?  Do they do what you would expect?

10 points: are comments added to explain what's going on, and are those comments clear?


## Section 2 - Some questions and plots

This section is a total of 50 points, and requires quite a bit of coding.

**Question 1:** 10 points. 5 points for plots of both scenarios; 5 points for description.  The coyote behavior may be surprising because if there are lots of coyotes they breed before they die, and keep breeding.

**Question 2:** 10 points. 5 points for plots of both scenarios; 5 points for description.  Out-of-equilibrium situations are fairly stochastic and dependent on initial conditions - be generous with grading.

**Question 3:** 10 points. 5 points for plot of all scenarios; 5 points for description.  The difference between explosive deer population and hunting to extinction is quite small in terms of P\_rem -- look for that.

**Question 4:** 10 points. 6 points for scenarios (2 or 3); 4 points for description of what's going on.  We're looking for some analysis of interesting scenarios.  Grade generously.

**Question 5:** 5 points.  Looking for any thoughts that the students have on this subject - grade generously.

**Question 6:** 5 points.  Looking for any thoughts that the students have on this subject - grade generously.  

## Section 3 - Feedback

Feedback: No points awarded, but take off 5 points if they don't answer the "how much time did you spend" question.  Don't do anything if they don't fill in the "What questions do you have?" question, or if they just put "none".
