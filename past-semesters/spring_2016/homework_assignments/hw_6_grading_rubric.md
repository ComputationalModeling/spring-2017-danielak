# Grading rubric for Homework 6

This assignment is worth 100 points (scaled to whatever is in the grade book).  The goal of this homework assignment was to use numerical integration to calculate the 2D motion of launched objects using air resistance.

**General guidelines:** I'm providing point totals at a relatively coarse level - subdivide/give partial credit as necessary.  We expect students to use functions and add comments as appropriate.

## Section 1 - The Model

This section is a total of 50 points.

35 points: Code itself. (It's very short, straightforward code.)  Look for appropriate treatment of x, y dimensions (each is independent), appropriate advancement of both position and velocity at the same time, and that it actually takes in and returns the things that we want (input: angle, speed. output: lists or arrays of position, velocity, times.)

10 points:  Did they use a function, as requested?  And does it behave as expected?  

10 points: are comments added to explain what's going on, and are those comments clear?


## Section 2 - Some questions and plots

This section is a total of 50 points, and requires quite a bit of coding.

**Question 1:**  15 points.  10 points for plot of all of the angles/speeds w/air resistance; 5 points for remembering to turn off air resistance.

**Question 2:**  5 points.  Just looking for something along the lines of "yes, air resistance is incredibly important, it really affects the answer" 

**Question 3:**  10 points.  Students should calculate this by looking at the amount of time it's in the air for a variety of angles and picking the largest one.  

**Question 4:**  10 points.  Students should try a bunch of angles and find the one with the largest x-distance.

**Question 5:**  10 points.  This is basically question #4 with a test to ensure that you don't exceed a height of 12 meters!

## Section 3 - Feedback

Feedback: No points awarded, but take off 5 points if they don't answer the "how much time did you spend" question.  Don't do anything if they don't fill in the "What questions do you have?" question, or if they just put "none".
