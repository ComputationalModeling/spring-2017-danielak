Please make sure to get started early, and come by the instructors' office hours if you have any questions.  Office horus and locations can be found in the course syllabus.  **IMPORTANT:** While it's fine if you talk to other people in class about this homework - and in fact we encourage it! - you are responsible for creating the  solutions for this homework on your own, and each student must submit their own homework assignment.\n",
