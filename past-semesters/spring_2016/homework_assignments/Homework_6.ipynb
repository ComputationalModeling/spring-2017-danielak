    "# Homework 6 - The T-Shirt Cannon\n",
    "\n",
    "The [MSU Science Festival](http://sciencefestival.msu.edu/) has decided that its existing marketing efforts are not effective enough at attracting peoples' attention, and has decided to enter a new era of high-velocity publicity.  You have been commissioned to build a [t-shirt cannon](http://www.tshirtgun.com/) to distribute Science Festival t-shirts in MSU's [large lecture halls](http://testingoffice.msu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lecture-hall-2.jpg) to raise public awareness for the festival.  **Your deliverables** for this highly lucrative contract are (1) a fully functioning t-shirt cannon and (2) a program that calculates ranges as a function of the t-shirt cannon's launch speed and launch angle, and some informative graphs so that the t-shirt cannon's operator can precisely target their long-distance PR efforts. You have [already constructed](http://www.instructables.com/id/T-shirt-Cannon/) your t-shirt cannon; now you need to make predictions about how far you can launch a t-shirt, taking into account the challenges inherent to the nascent, but potentially highly lucrative, field of indoor high-velocity garment distribution.  As part of your contract, you have agreed to provide software, tables, and graphs that model the behavior of the t-shirt cannon.  Once you do this, you will take your place in t-shirt cannon history, beside such innovators as the [San Antonio Coyote](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/magazine/who-made-that-t-shirt-cannon.html?_r=0) (also known as the Tesla of T-Shirt Cannons).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paragraphs below, we provide you with some background knowledge that you will need for this model as well as detailed instructions for the assignment itself.  Happy simulating!  And remember... you're [securing your place in history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b3pJYfv5eg) with this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** While it's fine to talk with others about this homework - and in fact we strongly encourage you to do so - **you need to write your own code and turn in your own homework assignment!**  \n",

    "### Position, velocity, and acceleration \n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework assignment, we are going to model a relatively simple system - namely, the launching of a t-shirt.  An object's position ($\\vec{x}$) and velocity ($\\vec{v}$) evolve according to a straightforward set of mathematical rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{x} = \\vec{x}_0 + \\int_0^t \\vec{v} dt$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}_0 + \\int_0^t \\vec{a} dt$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{a} = \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum \\vec{F}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $\\vec{a}$ is the acceleration and m is the mass of the t-shirt.  $\\vec{x}_0$ and $\\vec{v}_0$ are the position and velocity at $t=0$, respectively.  The little arrows on top of letters indicate *vector quantities* - i.e., quantities that have direction as well as magnitude.  With vector quantities, you can separate the components and solve them independently - for example, you only need to know the x-velocity to calculate the x-position (though ultimately you may need some quantities that need information from both - you need the speed, which includes x- and y-velocity, to calculate the acceleration due to air resistance).  In the last term of the third equation, the sum is over all forces acting on the object (i.e., the t-shirt).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The forces acting on the object are gravity, which points downward with a magnitude of $g=9.81$m s$^{-2}$, and air resistance, which can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{F}_{air} = -\\frac{1}{2} C \\rho A v^2 \\hat{v}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where C is a constant corresponding to the shape of the object ($C=0.47$ for a sphere, $C=2.0$ for an Industry Standard T-Shirt, or IST), $\\rho$ is the density of the atmosphere, 1.2 kg/m$^3$, A is the cross-sectional area of the object, v is the magnitude of the velocity, and $\\hat{v}$ is the unit vector of the velocity.  Note the minus sign - this means that the force of air resistance always opposes the motion of the object, regardless of its direction.\n",

    "Your task is to create a code that implements the equations presented above to model the position and velocity of the t-shirt cannon as a function of time.  You have been provided a function that calculates the acceleration on the t-shirt due to both air resistance and gravity; you need to write a function that takes in a *speed* (the magnitude of velocity) and a launch angle (i.e., the angle above horizontal that you are launching the t-shirt) and returns lists of horizontal and vertical positions and velocities, as well as times.\n",
    "\n",

Use functions when possible, and make sure that your code is clearly written and has comments explaining what everything does.  Also make sure that all plots are clearly marked with axis labels and a title!"
