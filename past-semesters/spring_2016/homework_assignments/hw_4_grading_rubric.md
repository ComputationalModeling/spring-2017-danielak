# Grading rubric for Homework 4

This assignment is worth 100 points (scaled to whatever is in the grade book).  The goal of this homework assignment was to implement a simple variant of the 2D Schelling model and produce some visualizations of it.  I'm providing point totals at a relatively coarse level - subdivide/give partial credit as necessary.

## Section 1 (The model)

65 points total for this section.

**Code:** 35 points.

* Does the code produce the correct solution? (20 points)  Note that this is not all-or-nothing - if it doesn't, knock off some fraction of points depending on how broken it is.  If it doesn't run at all, maybe just a few points, but if it doesn't quite work correctly, assign most of the points.
* Is the code broken up into functions in a logical manner? (10 points)  Again, use discretion - not all solutions will be identical!
* Is the code clearly structured and easy to read? (5 points)

**Comments:** 15 points.

* Does every function have a comment string that explains what it does (including inputs and outputs)? (10 points) Note that I am not 100% sure I told the students to explicitly document inputs and outputs, so if they don't have that explicitly just make sure to comment on it.
* Do tricky pieces of code have comments that explain their intent?  (5 points - deduct ~1 point per missing comment)

**Plots:** 15 points.  Plots must be easy to read and have sensibly-sized polygons.  If they're hard to read, knock off a few points from this section.

* Does the code plot the initial state of the board? (3 points)
* Does the code plot the final state of the board? (3 points)
* Does the code plot the evolution of the segregation metric, "meh" fraction, and "happy" fraction over time?  (3 points apiece; 9 points total)

## Section 2 (Some questions)

25 points total for this section.  

* Question 1: (8 points)
* Question 2: (8 points)
* Question 3: (9 points)

## Section 3 (feedback)

10 points total for this section - 5 points for an answer to each question.
