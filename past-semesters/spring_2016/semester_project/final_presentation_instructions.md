# CMSE 201 / NSC 204 final presentation

For your semester project, you have been asked to find a computational model that is interesting to you, and that you think you understand reasonably well now that you have taken this course.   At this point, you've selected your model and done some background research.  Now, you need to tell everybody else in class about what you've learned, and answer any questions that they might have!

## Presentation details

### Overall requirements

Your presentation should be approximately six minutes long and have appropriate visual aids in the form of Powerpoint slides.  You will be graded on the clarity of your oral presentation and slides as well as on the content of your presentation.

In your presentation, you need to address four points:

1. What is the model that you've chosen, and what is it used for?  (In other words, why is this model interesting and why should I care?)
2. How does the model work?  In other words, what are the numerical algorithms that underly the model?
3. How does this model connect to what we've done in class and to your own interests?  Explain how you could apply what you've learned in class to create a model like this.
4. What sort of data is this model compared to, and how would I decide if the model was good or bad?

Each of the four points above should be addressed in 1 or 2 powerpoint slides, and you should include plots, images, or animations when necessary to demonstrate how the model works, its inputs, or its outputs.  You are welcome to use notes for your presentation, and I strongly encourage you to practice your talk ahead of time!

### Talk slides

All of the talks will use the instructor's computer.  As a result, you must create slides using Powerpoint or a PDF.  You can have **up to seven slides** (including the title slide), which should conform to the following guidelines:

* The title slide should contain your name, the name of the model that you will be explaining, and the course number (NSC 204).  You can add some sort of graphic/image/animation if you want, but you don't have to!
* The slides that answer the four questions asked above need to have titles that are short versions of the questions, and should be answered in the order that they're asked.
* Make sure that your slides effectively communicate the information you wish to convey.  This includes:
  * Having legible figures and text that's large enough to read from the back of the classroom.
  * Choice of text/figures and background colors that are easy to read.  For example, black, blue, or red text or lines on a white background are easy to read, but yellow/cyan is extremely difficult to see on a white background.  Red or dark blue are often hard to see on a dark background.
  * Carefully choose the text and graphics that you put on the slides to complement what you're saying! **Do not** put paragraphs of text on the slides - if you're worried about forgetting something, make notes for yourself!
* If you use a PDF document instead of slides, the shape of the pages of the PDF need to conform to the shape of a standard powerpoint slide (i.e., landscape instead of portrait orienation).

All talks will be given using the instructor's computer.  You are responsible for ensuring that the slides run on a Mac using the latest version of Powerpoint!

## Grading

Your final project is worth 20% of your semester grade, with 5% of this coming from the research that you've already turned in and the remaining 15% coming from your presentation.  The presentation will be graded as follows:

* 1/3 of the grade comes from your oral presentation.  Is it clear and well-structured?  Do you effectively communicate the key ideas about your model?
* 1/3 of the grade comes from your slides.  Do your slides complement your presentation, and conform to the guidelines described above?
* 1/3 of the grade comes from the content of your presentation.  Do you clearly and concisely answer all four of the questions that you were asked to answer?

## Turning in your slides

**Your completed slides should be turned in by 5 p.m. on Sunday April 24th.**  Hand the slides in via the "Final presentation slides" Dropbox in the "Semester project" folder on Desire2Learn. **Late submissions will not be accepted under any circumstances, and you are responsible for ensuring that the correct file is uploaded and is readable.**  You can verify that your file is uploaded correctly by downloading the file from the Dropbox and trying to open it.  If you're worried about it, also send a copy of the file to your instructor via email!
