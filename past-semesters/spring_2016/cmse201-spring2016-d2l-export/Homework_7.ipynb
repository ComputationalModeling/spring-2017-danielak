    "# Homework 7 - \"Catch me if you can!\" - Modeling predators and prey\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common interactions between species of animals is the **predator-prey** relationship, which can take many forms.  These interactions are critical to the health of animal populations and to the flow of energy through an ecosystem, and altering these populations (by hunting, for example) can have significant consequences to an ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Michigan Department of Natural Resources](https://www.michigan.gov/dnr) (DNR) has been examining the population of deer on [North Manitou Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Manitou_Island) (part of [Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Bear_Dunes_National_Lakeshore)).  The main large predators are North Manitou Island are [coyotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyote), and the main large prey animals are [white-tailed deer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-tailed_deer).  There are not enough coyotes on the island due to former residents of the island hunting them, and the deer population is getting too large.  One consequence of this is that there is not enough readily available food for the deer population, which is destroying the vegetation on the island and also affecting the health of the deer.  The DNR has decided that some number of deer should be removed from the population (by hunting or transportation to the mainland) in order for the remaining population to stay at a healthy level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You have been asked by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources to make a model of the interactions between coyotes and deer to determine how many deer should be removed from North Manitou Island.**  You're going to do this by developing an agent-based model of the interactions between coyotes and deer, and vary the number and properties of both species to examine how the populations change in relation to each other.  In the sections below, we will provide you with some instructions on how to set up the model and some specific questions that the Michigan DNR would like to know the answers to.  Happy simulating!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** While it's fine to talk with others about this homework - and in fact we strongly encourage you to do so - **you need to write your own code and turn in your own homework assignment!**  \n",

    "* The island is represented by a square grid of cells that is $N_{G}$ on a side.\n",
    "* The model takes a total of $N_{S}$ steps.\n",
    "* There are two species, Coyotes and Deer, with $N_{C}$ coyotes and $N_{D}$ deer initially, which are placed at random places on the island (i.e., in random cells on the board).  \n",
    "* If a coyote does not catch a deer after $N_{eat}$ turns, it dies of starvation.  Deer are assumed to have sufficient food.  (Not really true, but we're simplifying for this model.)\n",
    "* Both species move around the island island randomly, moving one cell in any direction per time step.  (Note that \"any direction\" means into any of the up to 8 adjacent cells!)  \n",
    "  * Animals at the edge of the board cannot leave the board - they must move in some other direction.\n",
    "  * Animals cannot move into a cell that is already occupied by another animal.\n",
    "  * If an animal has nowhere to move (i.e., it is totally surrounded by other animals) it stays still.\n",
    "* If two deer end up in adjacent cells, there is a probability $P_{d}$ that the two deer breed and produce a new deer.  The new deer is placed in one of the cells immediately adjacent to the other two deer.\n",
    "* If two coyotes end up in adjacent cells, there is a probability $P_{c}$ that the two coyotes breed and produce a new coyote.  The new coyote is placed in one of the cells immediately adjacent to the other two coyotes.\n",
    "* If a coyote is in a cell next to a deer, there is a probability $P_{eat}$ that the coyote catches and eats the deer.  In this case, the deer dies and is replaced by an empty cell.\n",
    "* Every step, there is a probability $P_{rem}$ that each deer is removed from the island's population by hunting or transport to the mainland.\n"
