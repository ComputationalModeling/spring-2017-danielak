# Base Python

## Importing Modules

- **Pull in external collections of bundled-up procedures** (import other modules/packages/libraries)

## Variables

- **Store information** for use later
- **Retrive Stored Information**

## Numerical Types

- **Represent numbers and convert** between their forms (`Int`, `Float`)
- **Perform operations on numbers** (for example, arithmetic. If you've never programmed before, `*` as the multiplication operator may not be obvious)

## String Types

- **Represent letters/words**
- **Perform operations on letters/words** (Find regular patterns, make substitutions, convert case, concatenate, split)?

## Data Types (Dicts, Lists)


- **Create data by composing words/letters and numbers** (A set is a bag/bucket of stuff. Dicts are like buckets of labeled stuff, where you can pull stuff by label. Lists are ordered like trains.)
- **Perform repeated operations on those compositions**, including iteration. (If we learn primitives and manipulating primitives, then it makes sense to learn compositions and manipulating compositions.)

## Functions

- **Bundle up repeated operations** so they're easier to invoke/apply later (function definition)
- **Invoke existing procedures** (calling functions)?  

# Matplotlib

- For a given plot:
    + Adjust the color, shape, and linetype of a plot
    + Label the axes of a plot
    + Specify custom axis limits
    + Title a plot
- Create different types of plots including:
    + bar chart/dot chart
    + bivariate scatterplot
    + line graphs
    + time series graphs
- Solve problems graphically
    + Plot horizontal/vertical lines to indicate critical values


# Scipy

# Numpy

- **Get statistical information** about a collection of numerical data. (the `max`, `min`, `cumsum`, `var` and `mean` methods of `ndarray`, for example)
- Perform operations using the numbers in a collection (the `sum` method of an `ndarray`, for example)
- **Iterate over an array of data** (`numpy.nditer`?)
