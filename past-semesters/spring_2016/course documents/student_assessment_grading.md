# In-class grading

**Purpose:** This document describes the scoring system and process for in-class evaluation, feedback, and grade assignment.  The overall goal of doing extensive in-class assessment is to encourage students to maximize their learning in this class by:

* Coming to class having fully engaged with the pre-class assignments
* Actively engage in class every day, including both single-student and group assignments
* Interact with members of their group, other members of the class, and instructional staff in a respectful, constructive way

## In-class evaluation

Students will be given the student\_centered\_actions.md file (or a paper/pdf copy thereof), which describes the types of behaviors that we're looking for.  While class is going on, instructional staff will pay attention to some subset of the groups for the purposes of grading, with some attempts to alternate groups between instructors to get some semblance of inter-rater calibration and increase reliability of assessment.  The "Instructor Assessment Sheet"  (Instructor\_Assessment\_Sheet.pdf) is meant to facilitate these observations - it's not necessarily meant to be filled in as class goes on, but at least right afterwards while student behaviors are still fresh.

Evaluation is conducted in three dimensions:

* Group understanding - are the group members working cooperatively to ensure that everybody understands what's going on in class conceptually?
* Group focus - are group members working together constructively?
* Individual understanding - does each individual group member taking ownership of their own understanding by doing their best to ensure that their own understanding is aligned with that of their fellow students and the course instructional staff?

## Feedback

Feedback will be given to each group and its members approximately once every two week.  In the first few weeks of class, this will be purely informational - all grades will be given based on attendance and some minimal level of participation - but after roughly week three we will start grading in earnest.

Grades will be given for all three dimensions, but feedback will primarily target one of the dimensions (rotating among the three).  Some effort should be made for feedback to be a consensus among instructors.  For each student, at least one or two positive things should be highlighted, as well as one or two things that could be improved - and, **most importantly**, concrete suggestions for how to improve their participation in class!

## Grade assignment

Grades will be given on MSU's standard 0.0 - 4.0 scale, with grades approximately translating to:

* 0.0 - completely non-participatory (0%)
* 1.0 - sub-standard, needs major improvements (50%)
* 2.0 - fair, needs significant improvement (70%)
* 3.0 - good, needs some improvement (85%)
* 4.0 - excellent, needs little to no improvement (100%)

Percentages are not linearly scaled; the point of this feedback is to not be punitive, but rather to incentivize students to work on improving their group collaboration skills.  The grading scale will be constructed in such a way that if a general upward trajectory is seen, students will get the vast majority of the participation points for the semester.

In terms of grading, grades should start in the range of 2.25-3.0, and never in the 4.0 range.  The reason for this is to telegraph to students that there is room for improvement, and to incentivize their efforts to improve.  Week-by-week scores should never go down without *substantial* reason for doing so, and should in general only go up a quarter-point at a time when they do go up.
