- Every handout to students should be an ipython notebook
- Move "setup" from the current document to the instructor version
- Distill the FAQ into one single paragraph about articulating the rules and assumptions students are making
- Add a "What is the point of this assignment (learning goals)" for every assignment

## Template for student assignments/handouts

### Title

### Learning goals (short version)

### Put your student/group name here

### Assignment (could be multiparts)

```python
# Code and markdown would go here
```

### General Assignment Feedback box (FILL THIS OUT BEFORE YOU SUBMIT)

#### For pair/group assignments

Each one of these might be its own markdown cell:

```python
# What parts of this assignment did you feel worked well?
```

```python
# What parts of this assignment didn't work as well?
```

```python
# As a group/individual, what questions do you still have after this assignment?
```

```python
# Can you suggest any improvements/things we should think about?
```

#### For individual assignments

- What questions do you still have?
- What do you feel you wish/want to know more about?

### Hand-in instructions for submitting stuff

## Template for Instructor material

### Title

### Learning Goals

- How this connects to past material (What are the callbacks?)
- What we hope they get out of this activity/assignment
- What this sets up for future stuff

Thinking N-1, N, N+1, 

### Desired student behaviors: what to watch for and note

- Behavioral indicators of student learning
- phrases
- drawings

### Implementation Notes (How to run this thing)

- Group size (if applicable)
- Specific questions to ask
- Timing (desired total time; time per subsection)
- Expected student problems/questions/issues

### Expected student issues

This can be a core-dump after class of what went awry, but it's both negative AND positive. (Students really took to X, for example)
