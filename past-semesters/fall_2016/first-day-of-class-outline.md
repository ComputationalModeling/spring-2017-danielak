# Overall Changes

Three subdirectories
- Spring 2016 (old stuff)
- Fall 2016 (new stuff)
  - For instructors
- All of the resources from when we were creating content

# Day One

- Explain Grading
- Class overview
  - Why we're teaching it the way we are
- Who is this Brian Danielak Guy?
- Econophysics Activity (icebreaker)
  - When you record trade information, also record the name of the person you traded with
  - In groups, discuss:
  - Propose and play rule changes
  - Discuss in groups and create a list of: (5 mins)
    - How would we figure out who traded with the highest number of unique people?
    - Who made the most trades? How might we answer that?
    - What if we put in a "tracker" coin (a quarter, say). How would we represent the travel/history of where that coin went.
    - What if we put in more than one tracker coin?
    - As a group, write down those questions; that'll be our jumping off point for day 2
- What do people wanna get out of the class
- Revisiting Goals Throughout the semester
  - Periodic check-ins (every 3-4 weeks, you'll look at a goal you made in the past, then write a paragraph in-class reflecting on what's happened since you made that goal. Include your questions, your frustrations, whether the goal has changed).

# Day Two changes
- Move the group norms discussion to after the cold spread activity
- Do the cold spread activity
- Reflect on the relationship between
  - Day 1 activity (econophysics) vs.
  - Day 2 activity (cold spread) vs.
  - the model you found on your own
  - What's similar? What's different?

# Day Three Changes

- Move the programming to homework assignment
- Introduce NetLogo with the `virus` model from the NetLogo Model Library (Cmd+M)
