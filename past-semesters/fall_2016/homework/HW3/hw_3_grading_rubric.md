# Grading rubric for Homework 3

This assignment is worth 100 points (scaled to whatever is in the grade book), divided up in the following way.

Note that we're going to give credit based on code quality, correctness, and whether or not it runs.  Here's what the students were told:

**Code quality:** make sure that you use functions whenever possible, use descriptive variable names, and use comments to explain what your code does as well as function properties (including what arguments they take, what they do, and what they return).

**Whether your code runs:** prior to submitting your homework assignment, re-run the entire notebook and test it. Go to the "kernel" menu, select "Restart", and then click "clear all outputs and restart." Then, go to the "Cell" menu and choose "Run all" to ensure that your code produces the correct results. We will take off points for code that does not work correctly.

We didn't spell out what we meant by "code correctness", but basically it means "does it produce the right answer?"  The solution does not have to be identical to what's in the solutions I've provided to you, but it *does* need to work.


## Section 1 (2D random walk)

25 points total for this section.  Point breakdown:

10 points for Part 1, broken down as follows:

* 3 points for code quality (0 for no comments/functions; 1 for poor comments/functions; 2 for some; 3 for adequate comments/functions)
* 3 points for whether it runs (0 or 3; does or doesn't run)
* 4 points for correctness (use your judgment here)

10 points for Part 2, graded as above

5 points for Question: grade generously, as long as they give a reasonable answer.

## Section 2 (1D random walk with weighting)

20 points total for this section.  Point breakdown:

12 points for the code, broken down as follows:

* 4 points for code quality (0 for no comments/functions; 1 for poor comments/functions; 2 for some; 4 for adequate comments/functions)
* 4 points for whether it runs (0 or 4; does or doesn't run)
* 4 points for correctness (use your judgement here)

8 points for the questions:

* 4 points for question 1: grade generously but give just 0 or 4 points; they need to say that it's skewed in some way.
* 4 points for question 2: as above; need to show that it's consistent with a normal random walk at p=0.5 and that it basically goes in a straight line at p=1.  

## Section 3 (Modeling drug doses in the human body)

55 points total for this section.  Point breakdown:

* 25 points for the code, broken down as follows:
  * 10 points for code quality (0 for no comments/functions; 3 for poor comments/functions; 6 for some; 10 for adequate comments/functions)
  * 5 points for whether it runs (0 or 10; does or doesn't run)
  * 10 points for correctness (use your judgement here)
* 5 points for Question 1: 2 points for answer, 3 points for showing a histogram.
* 5 points for Question 2: all or nothing - did they give the percentages?
* 10 points for Question 3: 5 points for answer, 5 points for plot.  Make sure that the plot supports the answer and the code they've written - depending on how they choose to write their code (i.e., if they decide to ignore Johnson) they might have a somewhat different result than if they take into account 3rd-party candidates.
* 10 points for Question 4: they don't need to give an exhaustive list, but I do want to see some evidence that they've read the 538 blog post that I linked to and given some thought to the differences between what they've done and what 538.com does.  Let's go with 0 points for a cursory analysis, 5 points for listing a single reason, and 10 points for listing 2 or more reasons.  (If they don't pose it in a list-based format, use your judgment.)
