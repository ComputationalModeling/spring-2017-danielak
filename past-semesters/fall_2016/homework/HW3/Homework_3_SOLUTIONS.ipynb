    "\n",
    "We're going to finish up the \"random walk\" project that we started in class.  In this section, we're going to do it in two dimensions, x and y.  You need to write a program that performs a random walk that starts at the origin (x=y=0), picks a random direction (up, down, left, or right), and take one step in that direction.  You will then randomly pick a new direction, take a step, and so on, for a total of $N_{step}$ = 1000 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**First:** Write the code to do this for a single random walk, and keep track of the (x,y) position of your walker for each step in the random walk.  Make a plot showing the path for this random walk.  Make sure to write a function that decides what direction the walker will go on each step, and returns that information to your program."

    "## Section 3:  Modeling the presidential election\n",
    "\n",
    "The final part of this homework is the creation of a model of the 2016 Presidential Election that's similar to those used at election prediction sites such as [FiveThirtyEight][1].  You've been provided with a link to a CSV (comma-separated value) file containing information about each of the 50 states as well as the District of Columbia, and you'll use this to make election predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A quick civics lesson:** The United States does not directly elect the President and Vice President of the United States.  Instead, they choose \"Electors\" that are apportioned to each state based on the most recent [U.S. census][3] results (equal to the number of members of Congress to which that state receives).  Electors are typically required to vote for the candidate with the majority of the popular vote in their state.  At the moment, there are 538 Electors in the [\"Electoral College.\"][2], and to win the presidency a candidate needs to recieve half plus one of those votes, or 270 votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The data file:**  Each row of the provided CSV file contains information about one of the 50 states or Washington D.C.  This information includes: the state name and abbreviation, the the number of electoral votes that state receives in the Electoral College, the state's polling information, the number of people surveyed in the last poll, and then information for each of the three candidates with significant popular support:  [Hilary Clinton][4], [Donald Trump][5], and [Gary Johnson][6].  For each candidate, the number corresponds to the percentage of the voting population that intends to vote for them according to the polls, as well as the margin of error of the poll.  Note that we are only using the **most recent poll** for each state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Margin of error:**  The \"margin of error\" of the poll represents uncertainty in polling data - typically only hundreds of people are polled at any given time, and pollsters are attempting to extrapolate from that sample of people to all of the likely voters in the state.  This error is typically calculated assuming that the uncertainty is a [\"normal\" (or \"Gaussian\")][7] distribution, and the reported error is the \"standard deviation\".  For example, Polls in Michigan indicate that Hilary Clinton is currently favored by 42% of the voting population, with a margin of error of 1.71%.  This means that the most likely outcome is for 42% of the population to vote for Clinton, with a 68% likelihood that the real percentage is between 40.29-43.71%, and a 95% chance likelihood that the real percentage is between 38.58-45.42%.\n",

    "We are going to attempt to duplicate the [FiveThirtyEight election predictions](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/), which predict not just who will win the election but what the range of likely outcomes will be. In particular, we're going to reproduce the [expected distribution of Electoral College votes](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/#electoral-vote) for each candidate.  To do this, we need to run large numbers of model elections - say, $N_{elec} = 10,000$ - and keep track of the results for each one.  To do so, you need to do the following for each of your model elections:\n",

    "* Write a function that, for each state, calculates the percentage of the popular vote that votes for each candidate, decides who the winner is (i.e., who has the most votes), and then returns the number of Electoral College votes received by that person for that state.  Almost all states are a \"winner take all\" state with regards to Electoral College votes, so whoever wins the popular vote receives all Electoral College votes for that state.  Note that you can use the  [Python random module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html)'s `random.normalvariate()` function, or the  [NumPy random module](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.random.html)'s `random.normal()` function to calculate the possible outcomes from a Gaussian distribution, given the mean and standard deviation.\n",

    "**ANSWER:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our distribution is different - the median values for Clinton's number of electoral votes that we predicted are lower than FiveThirtyEight's (~325 instead of ~350), and the distribution we predict is narrower.  The same is true for Trump's votes, but we predict higher numbers than 538 (but still a narrower distribution).  It's not totally obvious why we get different results, but there are several possibilities based on their [description of their methodology](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-users-guide-to-fivethirtyeights-2016-general-election-forecast/):\n",
    "\n",
    "* We are using instantaneous poll results and a single poll per state, and 538 uses a more complex set of data that includes multiple polls for each state, with a weighting scheme that takes into account how long it has been since the poll was done, and also attempts to correct for bias of each pollster (i.e., some tend to swing Republican or Democrate; historical data can be used to normalize this).\n",
    "* 538 uses economic data to try to make adjustments to their predictions, and we don't do that.\n",
    "* 538 uses a different error model than we do - a t-distribution instead of a Gaussian distribution of outcomes, which gives more weight to the tails of the distribution.  They also take into account something other than Poisson noise (and a modified error taking into account other uncertainties) for each poll so that errors are greater.\n",
    "* 538 treats the fraction of undecided voters differently than we do (we ignore it; they divide them among the candidates).  This also may tie into the error budget that they use.\n",
    "* 538 may do something different with Gary Johnson's voters, and assume that some will defect prior to the election and go to another of the candidates.\n",
    "* We are implicitly assuming that the polls are accurate and that all of the population will vote.  We don't take into account demographic issues or trying to figure out what *likely* voters think, which 538 attempts to do at some level.\n",
