For those near the end of the line the rule is that, of the four neighbors on the side toward the center plus the one, two or three outboard neighbors, at least half must be like oneself.\n",

Print out the state of the list at each step so that you can see how the solution evolves.\n",

While this is not a perfectly representative way of visualizing data, it gives a good sense of what words are commonly used.  So, here's how we will proceed:\n",

You'll take each list, convert it into a string, clean up the string, and then make it into a word cloud.  This is kind of a pain, so we're including example code below.  Note that we are only showing you how to generate a simple word cloud - to make a more complicated one, look at the [documentation](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud)."
