    "**ANSWER:** There's not really a \"solution\" to this problem, per se.  We want to see that students have found an actual model online (as opposed to something else that may have inputs and outputs and so on, but which is not a model).  The model can be descriptive (i.e., carbon cycle), predictive (black hole mergers and gravitational waves), or some sort of statistical model (i.e., fantasy baseball-type modeling of player performance)."

    "**ANSWER:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to figure out how much gas is consumed by a typical car during its lifetime, and then answer some questions relating to that.  To figure this out, we need to know the volume of a gallon of gas ($V_{1 gal}$), the mass of a gallon of gas ($M_{1 gal}$), the cost of a gallon of gas ($C_{1 gal}$), the fuel efficiency of the car in question ($M_{PG}$), and the number of miles that a car is tyipcally driven ($M_{drive}$).  In that case, the model would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$V_{gas} = V_{1 gal} * N_{gals} = V_{1 gal} * \\frac{M_{drive}}{M_{PG}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "and for the total mass of gas:\n",
    "\n",
    "$M_{gas} = M_{1 gal} * N_{gals} = M_{1 gal} * \\frac{M_{drive}}{M_{PG}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the cost for all of the gas:\n",
    "\n",
    "$C_{gas} = C_{1 gal} * N_{gals} = C_{1 gal} * \\frac{M_{drive}}{M_{PG}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The various quantities we need are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $V_{1 gal}$ - 3785 cubic cm (via google)\n",
    "* $M_{1 gal}$ - 2.9 kg (via Google)\n",
    "* $C_{1 gal}$ - between \\$2 - \\$5 depending on where you live and when it is\n",
    "* $M_{drive}$ - between $10^5$ and $5 \\times 10^5$ miles\n",
    "* $M_{PG}$ - between $8-60$ miles per gallon depending on the type of car you drive\n",
    "* Mass of car: between 1000-4000 kg depending on the type of car you drive (cars with poorer fuel efficiency tend to be more massive)\n",
    "\n",
    "This estimate is limited because the cost of gasoline varies over time and fuel efficiency also varies over time with weather and also with the age and maintenance of the car.  It's also somewhat hard to tell how long a given car is driven, because cars are often resold."

Bottle 1 typically has the highest lead value, bottle 2 the second-highest, and bottle 3 the third highest, which is what one would expect.  In the first two dates, Bottle 1 has more than 10% of samples above the action limit, and in the third date it is slightly below the action limit.  Overall, this indicates that the problem is getting slightly better over time, but is still worrisome."

The various lines show where the minimim sample value is, 25th percentile, etc., all the way up to the maximum sample value.  This shows that the maximum lead measurements for Bottle 1 are always really high, but that the situation overall seems to be improving (as indicated by the values for houses between the 50th and 95th percentile generally decreasing over time).  Nearly 10% of the houses are still over the action limit as of July 2016, and probably around 8% are still over it."
