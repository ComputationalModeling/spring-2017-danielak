# Grading rubric for Homework 1

This assignment is worth 100 points (scaled to whatever is in the grade book), divided up as follows:

## Section 1 ("Find me a model, any model")

20 points total for this section.  If whatever the student chose is not actually a model in the way we've been discussing them in class, do not give them credit for this section at all.  Point breakdown:

* 5 points: does the student's description of the model make sense?  (In other words, is it readable and coherent?)
* 10 points: does the student correctly identify the inputs, inner workings, and outputs of the model?
* 5 points: do they talk about how one might decide if this is a good model or not?
* **Note:** if the students do *not* cite the sources for their model (i.e., the web page or pages where they found the model), take ten points away.

## Section 2 (Car conundrum)

30 points total for this section.  

**Description of model:**  15 points total, broken down as follows:

* 10 points: did the student come up with a simple order of magnitude model that makes sense?  It doesn't have to be exactly like the model in the solutions, but if it's too simple take away 5 points.  They also have to answer the questions asked, and if they don't take away 2 points per question not answered (note that the questions may be answered as part of their explanation, and not explicitly):

  * What are the factors you need to consider? 
  * What range of values might they have? 
  * In what way is your estimate limited?
* 5 points: did the students answer the question "does it matter what type of car you choose?" in a satisfactory way?

**Code and plot:**  15 points total, broken down as follows: 

* 5 points: does their code adequately represent the model described in the previous section?
* 5 points: do they plot the model outputs using a histogram or plot of some sort?
* 5 points: do they answer the question "Do the answers make sense to you?"


## Section 3 (Flint data, redux)

50 points total for this section.


**Code:** 15 points. 

  * 10 points:  Is the code that created the plots and analysis included in the notebook?
  * 5 points: Does the code actually run without crashing when you try to execute the notebook?

**Plots/charts:** 15 points.

  * 10 points: Do the plots and/or charts of quantitative data show information that is useful for making an argument about the questions asked of the students?
  * 5 points: has any effort been made to add axis labels, figure captions, legends, etc. to the data?

**Narrative and presentation:** 20 points.

  * 10 points:  Do the students adequately answer the two questions?  ("How bad was the situation in Aug. 2015?" and "How has the situation changed since then?") - 5 points per question
  * 5 points:  Are the figures and/or quantitative results that they create referred to to support their position?
  * 5 points:  Is any effort made to consider counter-arguments?  (i.e., how somebody might use their data in a different way)
