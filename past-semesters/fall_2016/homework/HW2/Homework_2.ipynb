    "In this part of the homework, we're going to finish what we started regarding modeling the count rate of radioactive data that you worked wtih in class, to try to estimate the strength of the radioactive background that was seen in the radioactive count rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In class, we discussed that for radioactive material with an initial amount $N_0$ and a half life $t_{1/2}$, the amount left after time t is $N(t) = N_0 2^{-t/t_{1/2}}$.  The expected radioactive decay rate is then:\n",

    "However, the data doesn't agree well with this - there's something contaminating our count rate data that's causing a radioactive \"background\" that is approximately constant with time.  A better estimate of the count rates is more like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathrm{CR}(t) = \\mathrm{CR}_{\\mathrm{S}}(t) + \\mathrm{CR}_{\\mathrm{BG}}$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We're now going to try to figure out the values that go into the expressions for $\\mathrm{CR}_{\\mathrm{S}}(t)$ and $\\mathrm{CR}_{\\mathrm{BG}}$ by using the data.  What you're going to do is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"Smooth\" the decay rate data over N adjacent samples in time to get rid of some of the noise.  Try writing a piece of code to loop over the array of data and average the sample you're interested in along with the N samples on either side (i.e., from element i-N to i+N, for an arbitrary number of cells).  Store this smoothed data in a new array (perhaps using ``np.zeros_like()`` to create the new array?).\n",
    "2. Plot your smoothed data on top of the noisy data to ensure that it agrees.\n",
    "3. Create a new array with the analytic equation from above that describes for the decay rate as a function of time, taking into account what you're seeing in point (2), and try to find the values of the various constants in the equation.  Plot the new array on top of the raw data and smoothed values. \n",

    "The water level in the Great Lakes fluctuates over the course of a year, and also fluctuates in many-year cycles.

In this part of the homework assignment, we're going to look at water height data from the [Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory](https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/data/) - in particular, data from [1918 to the present day](https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/data/dashboard/data/levels/1918_PRES/).  In the cell below this, we're using Pandas to load four CSV (\"Comma-Separated Value\") files with data from Lake Eric, Lakes Michigan and Huron combined, Lake Ontario, and Lake Superior into data frames.  Each dataset contains the annual average water level for every year from 1918 to the present.  Use these datasets to answer the questions posed below."

    "\n",
    "Modeling the behavior of drugs in the human body is very important in medicine.  One frequently-used model is called the [\"Single-Compartment Drug Model\"](http://sepia.unil.ch/pharmacology/index.php?id=72), which takes the complex human body and treats it as one homogeneous unit, where drug distribution is instantaneous, the concentration of the drug in the blood (i.e., the amount of drug per volume of blood) is proportional to the drug dosage, and the rate of elimination of the drug is proportional to the amount of drug in the system.  Using this model allows the prediction of the range of [therapeutic doses](http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/therapeutic+dose) where the drug will be effective.\n",

    "We'll first model the concentration in the body of aspirin, which is commonly used to treat headaches and reduce fever.  For adults, it is typical to take 1 or 2 325 mg tablets every four hours, up to a maximum of 12 tablets/day.  This dose is assumed to be dissolved immediately into the blood plasma.  (An average adult human has about 3 liters of blood plasma.)  The concentration of drugs in the blood (represented with the symbol **Q**) is typically measured in $\\mu$g/ml, where 1000 $\\mu$g (micrograms) = 1 mg (milligram).  For aspirin, the does that is effective for relieving headaches is typically between 150-300 $\\mu$g/ml, and the half-life for removal of the drug from the system is about 3.2 hours (more on that later).\n",

    "**Part 1:** We're now going to make a simple model of the amount of aspirin in the human body.  Assuming that an adult human has a headache and takes 2 325 mg aspirin tablets.  If the drug immediately enters their system, for how long will their headache be relieved?  Show a plot, with an appropriate title, x-axis label, and y-axis label, that shows the concentration of aspirin in the patient's blood over a 12-hour time span.  In your model, make sure to resolve the time evolution well - make sure that your individual time steps are only a few minutes!\n",
