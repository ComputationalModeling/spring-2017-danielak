    "\n",
    "1. \"Smooth\" the decay rate data over N adjacent samples in time to get rid of some of the noise.  Try writing a piece of code to loop over the array of data and average the sample you're interested in along with the N samples on either side (i.e., from element i-N to i+N, for an arbitrary number of cells).  Store this smoothed data in a new array (perhaps using ``np.zeros_like()`` to create the new array?).\n",
    "2. Plot your smoothed data on top of the noisy data to ensure that it agrees.\n",
    "3. Create a new array with the analytic equation from above that describes for the decay rate as a function of time, taking into account what you're seeing in point (2), and try to find the values of the various constants in the equation.  Plot the new array on top of the raw data and smoothed values. \n",

In this part of the homework assignment, we're going to look at water height data from the [Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory](https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/data/) - in particular, data from [1918 to the present day](https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/data/dashboard/data/levels/1918_PRES/).  In the cell below this, we're using Pandas to load four CSV (\"Comma-Separated Value\") files with data from Lake Eric, Lakes Michigan and Huron combined, Lake Ontario, and Lake Superior into data frames.  Each dataset contains the annual average water level for every year from 1918 to the present.  Use these datasets to answer the questions posed below."

One frequently-used model is called the [\"Single-Compartment Drug Model\"](http://sepia.unil.ch/pharmacology/index.php?id=72), which takes the complex human body and treats it as one homogeneous unit, where drug distribution is instantaneous, the concentration of the drug in the blood (i.e., the amount of drug per volume of blood) is proportional to the drug dosage, and the rate of elimination of the drug is proportional to the amount of drug in the system.  Using this model allows the prediction of the range of [therapeutic doses](http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/therapeutic+dose) where the drug will be effective.\n",

(An average adult human has about 3 liters of blood plasma.)  The concentration of drugs in the blood (represented with the symbol **Q**) is typically measured in $\\mu$g/ml, where 1000 $\\mu$g (micrograms) = 1 mg (milligram).  For aspirin, the does that is effective for relieving headaches is typically between 150-300 $\\mu$g/ml, and the half-life for removal of the drug from the system is about 3.2 hours (more on that later).\n",
