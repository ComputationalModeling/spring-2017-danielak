# Day 4 - Flint water quality, I

## Goals for today's class

* Be able to use the pyplot module to create and manipulate plots
* Be able to use the Pandas module to work with data
* Be able to articulate what data is, how it is used, and be able to use it to make simple plots.

## Pre-class assignment

* Misc: point students towards links for IPython hints; Jupyter hints (cool stuff you can do with both).
* V: What are modules?  Use 'math' and 'pyplot' as examples.
* A: make a simple plot with pyplot.
* V: What is Pandas and how do you use it?
* A: do some basic data analysis with Pandas
* A: What questions do you have from the videos?  Any other concerns?  Approximately how long did this take you?  (Submit everything via notebook.)

## In-class activity overview
 
* P: announcements; discussion of group work in class.
* D: problems with pre-class assignment? How long did it take?
* D: What is data and how do we use it?
* A: Extracting meaning from data with plots: Flint Water Safety Data
* P: end-of-class reminder: first homework assignment handed out today, due next Sunday!
 
## In-class activity details


* P: announcements (few minutes)
  * First homework will be handed out at the end of class today; we'll talk about it.
  * Reminder about office hours: they're in the syllabus and we have office hours pretty much every day.

* Group work in class (5 minutes)
  * We're now going to start evaluating you on how you participate in your group.  
  * Give out handout and talk about it.  The whole point is to help everybody figure out how to work in groups.  Any questions?
  * At the end of next week we will email everybody in the section feedback.  At the end of the following week, we'll start assigning grades.
  
* D/P: Discussion of pre-class assignment  (5 minutes)
  * Any problems?
  * Talk about making plots with pyplot - lots of ways to make plots!  (Do a quick coding example with pyplot.)
  
* D: What is data and how do we use it?
  * Get students to work as groups and think about what data *is* (i.e., what kinds of data one might come across, and what forms it might take) and how we might use it.
  * Want to get them to think about data as facts coming from observations, experiments, simulations/models, surveys, physical artifacts, etc. - all sorts of places.  Electronically, this can be numbers, text, images, other types of files.
  * Want them to think about data as being useful for measuring, estimating, making hypotheses/predictions, testing said hypotheses. 

* A: Extracting meaning from data with plots: Flint Water Safety Data
  * this is in in\_class\_activity\_instructor\_notes.md and in  day04-in-class-activity.ipynb

* End-of-class announcements (2 minutes):
  * First HW should be on Desire2Learn now, will be due next Friday (9/23).  This involves order-of-magnitude estimation and Flint water quality data, and a continuation of the project we've been working on in class today and next Mon/Tues.
  * You should have received an email about interviews with Brian Danielak.  Please consider interviewing!
