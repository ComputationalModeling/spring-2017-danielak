    "This is an implementation of a simple version of the 2D Schelling model.  We solve it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We create a 2D Numpy array that is 20x20 cells.  In our implementation, the number 0 will represent an empty cell, 1 will represent a triangle, and 2 will represent a square.  \n",
    "* We initialize the array with approximately 1/3 empty cells, 1/3 triangles, and 1/3 squares, all of which are placed in random cells.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we evolve this model using the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Neighbors are defined as polygons that are in any cell that's immediately adjacent (either left/right/up/down or diagonal) to a given polygon.\n",
    "* A polygon (triangle or square) is **happy** if at least 1/3 of its neighbors are like it\n",
    "* A polygon is **meh** if all of its neighbors are like it, or if it has no neighbors.\n",
    "* A polygon is considered to be **segregated** if all of its neighbors are like it, or if it has no neighbors.  The \"segregation measure\" is the fraction of polygons that are considered to be segregated.\n",
    "\n",
    "We evolve the board forward by randomly selecting a single *unhappy* polygon and moving it to an empty cell.  We continue doing so until every polygon is either *meh* or *happy*.  We keep track of how your segregation index evolves with each step, as well as the fraction of polygons that are *meh* and *happy*.  Finally, we plot both the board and (separately), the evolution of the segregation, meh fraction, and happy fraction over time."
