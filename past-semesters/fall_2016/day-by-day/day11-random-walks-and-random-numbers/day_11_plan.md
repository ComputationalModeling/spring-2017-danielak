# Day 11

## Goals for today's class

* Explore the properties of 1D and 2D random walks

## Pre-class assignment

* V: Random numbers
* A: Simple random number programming assignment
* V: Functions
* A: Simple function programming assignment

## In-class activity overview

* D/P: discussion of datasets for our analysis project
* P/D: recap of random numbers and functions (pre-class assignment)
* A: Random walk activity
* P: announcements
 
## In-class activity details

* D/P: discussion of datasets from analysis project (15 minutes).
  * Ask students to spend a minute or two describing the two datasets that they're interested in, as well as the three questions they're thinking about asking, to the students in their group.
  * The other group members need to give constructive criticism about which project seems more interesting and doable.
  * After that, we're going to go around the room and each student should talk about the **one** dataset they're leaning toward and at least one question they're going to try to answer with the dataset.

* P/D: recap of pre-class assignment (10 minutes)
  * Ask students to discuss the pre-class assignment and ask questions.
  * Give a very brief recap of random numbers and functions.  Show the documentation page for random and the various types of things that can be done.  Remind them of the function tutorial notebook.
* A: Random walk activity (90 minutes)
  * Motivation: random walks are widely used to model all sorts of different processes: financial modeling, population genetics, all sorts of stuff in physics, ecology, population dynamics, computer science.
  * Today we're going to create a model of the 1D and 2D random walk, and see how far the random walker goes after some number of steps.
  * See Random\_Walks.ipynb (and solutions notebook) for details.
* P: announcements
  * Dataset for data analysis project due Friday night - look in the "semester project" page for a Jupyter notebook that has all of the info we need.
