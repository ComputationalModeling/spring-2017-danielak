    "So far, so good! Finally, we are going to animate the loop using a dynamic display trick. What we will do is create a figure and keep clearing the figure and overwriting it with a new figure. In this example we just keep making a new random neighborhood 10 times while pausing a half second between each neighbornood.  If you were to do this for your own purposes, you'd probably do something different."
