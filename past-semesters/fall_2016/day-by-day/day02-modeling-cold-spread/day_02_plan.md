# Day 02

## Goals for today's class

* Pre-class assignment goals: 
  * ensure that students have Anaconda python and NetLogo up and running
  * Be able to provide a basic description of an algorithm, a computer program, and their relationship.
  * Be able to create and describe a simple model, its components, its inputs and outputs, and its limitations.

* In-class goals:
  * 

## Pre-class assignments

A:  Install Anaconda Python using directions in the syllabus (if you haven't already), and make sure you can log into Jupyter and load up an assignment.  Also make sure that you install NetLogo. Go to office hours if you have problems!

V+A: “What is an algorithm?  What is a program?” (notes in algorithms\_programs\_video.md)

V+A: “Python, IPython, IPython notebooks.  Why are we doing this?  What is it for?  (We’ll get into the details later.)

## In-class activity details

**As students are coming in:** Please put up announcement about MSU data science student group (slide is in this directory)

### D: Debrief of pre-class homework (5 minutes)

* Did people have any problems with the homework, especially the technology?
* Did people have problems getting NetLogo to work?
* How long did it take?  (Hopefully no more than an hour)


### A: Make a simple model: how does the cold spread at a party? (1 hour)

This is described in more detail in modeling-cold-spread.ipynb and modeling-cold-spread-INSTRUCTOR.md.  The students will need to download a notebook from the d2l page (in the "in-class assignments" folder), and re-upload a completed version once they're done.

A: Get students to make a simple model.  Get them to think about different representations - pictures, flow charts, etc.

D: Discussion: who has different representations?  How do different groups go about solving this problem?  (there’s often more than one way to do it!).  Is representation == model, or is there a layer of subtlety here?

A: Get them to play with the Virus model in NetLogo and explore what the different parameters mean.

D: Discussion: thinking about the Virus model - what can you learn?  How do you think it works under the hood?  How is it like what your group came up with or different than it?

P: Share Mike Murillo's model of the spread of a flu both with and without an antiviral drug [link here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kabxx8s2f88y9or/Detailed%20ABM%20with%205%25%20TX%20and%20Contact%20Tracing%20%28Choice%20B%29.mp4?dl=0).

### D/A: More general discussion of models. (20 minutes)

Get students together in their groups of 3-4 (an entire table) and have them talk about the econophysics model they acted out in the previous class and the cold/virus spread models they created and experimented with today.  Have each table pick one of the models and identify various characteristics of the model (to the extent that they can):

* The components of the model: inputs, outputs
* Assumptions that go into the model
* Limitations of the model
* How would you tell if the model is correct?

After the students spend some time talking about this their small groups, have a whole-classroom discussion.  What other kinds of model can they think of?  (Make a list.)


### D: Wrapup discussion on algorithms, programs, and models (10 minutes)

Get students to think about the simple model that they just made, as well as the discussion of algorithms and programs from the video.

* Can somebody give a quick recap of what an algorithm is?
* How about a computer program?
* How do they relate?
* How might we take our "cold spreading" model and turn it into a computer program?  (Tough realizing that we do not yet have programming experience, but let's go with it.)

### End of class

* Remind the students that there's no homework this week, but they should get started on the pre-class stuff for next week early - the next few pre-class assignments will be challenging!
* Remind the students that there are office hours this week, and they should come by with questions, etc.
* First homework will be assigned next week

## Instructor feedback

**Leave feedback on what happened in class today!**

* How you think it went
* What you felt went well
* What you and/or the students struggled with
* What changes you might make to future versions of today's activities.
