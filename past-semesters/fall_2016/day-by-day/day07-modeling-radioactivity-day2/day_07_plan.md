# Day 7 (Radioactivity - second day)

## Goals for today's class

* Create a model that shows the evolution of a system over time, using loops.  
* Create a model that uses Boolean logic within a loop to introduce limiting behavior.


## Pre-class assignment

None!

## In-class activity overview

* D: debrief of the previous class session
* A: make a model of exponential behavior using loops
* P: end-of-class reminders/announcements



## In-class activity details

* D: Debrief of previous class session (15 minutes)
  * Ask students to spend five minutes with their groups figuring out where they were last time, discussing their plans for today, and listing any questions they have about what they did last time and what they'd like to do this time.
  * Ask one or more groups to talk about what they did last time - use this as an opportunity to help the groups that are struggling a bit more.
  * Ask each group to volunteer one or more questions that they have from last time!

* A: make a model of exponential behavior using Boolean logic - finish up from last time!  (Should be most of class)
  * Materials are not copied into this directory - see everything from the last day of class!

* End-of-class announcements (2 minutes):
  * There will be **no class** on Monday/Tuesday Oct. 3rd/4th due to the CMSE Frontiers Workshop.  If you want to come by and check that out, please feel free - it's in the Kellogg Center.
  * HW 2 will be assigned this week, due next Friday (or thereabouts)
