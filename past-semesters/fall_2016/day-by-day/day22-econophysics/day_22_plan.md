## Pre-class assignment

* None

## In-class activity overview

* P: Announcements
* A: Econophysics

## In-class activity details

* P: Announcements
  * Homework 5 assigned, due last day of class (12/9).  **This is a big assignment; get started early.**
  * Research component for your final presentation (modeling component of the semester project) due Wednesday 11/23.  Talk to instructors if you have any questions!
  * CMSE 202 has plenty of open seats - please think about enrolling!  (See email about this as well!)
  * No class Wed/Thurs!
* A: Econophysics (rest of class)
  * See the instructor notes in the EconoPhysics-Activity directory for more information.  You will need a bunch of pennies (maybe 5 per student).
  * Have the students enact the simplest version of the game (1 coin per student), and then one with a small number coins per student.
  * Revisit discussion about how you could make the game more complex.
  * Have the students create the pseudo-code for a simple version of the game (arbitrary number of rounds, amount of money per agent, and number of agents), and then implement it.
  * After the students implement it (or get pretty far in the implementation) ask them about how they might modify the code to make it more complex.
