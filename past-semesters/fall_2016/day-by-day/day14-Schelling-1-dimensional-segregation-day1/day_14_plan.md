# Day 14

## Goals for today's class

* Learn how simple choices can lead to complex and unexpected outcomes (i.e., emergent behavior)
* Learn how to manipulate lists 

## Pre-class assignment

* List tutorial

## In-class activity overview

**NOTE:** hand out pennies and nickels before class starts so you don't have to do it during the activity - have every group take 20 pennies, 20 nickels!

* P: Announcements
* D: Discussion of list tutorial
* A: Schelling model
 
## In-class activity details

**NOTE:** hand out pennies and nickels before class starts so you don't have to do it during the activity - have every group take 20 pennies, 20 nickels!

* P: Announcements (few minutes)
  * Update: Homework 3 is now due next Tuesday night, November 1st
  * Preliminary data analysis project is due Friday, Oct. 28th
  * There will be a pre-class assignment for the next class - we'll talk about it at the end!

* D: Discussion of pre-class assignment (list tutorial)  (5-10 minutes)
  * Form students into groups - work through their solutions to the list tutorial.
  * Then, whole-class discussion about this - any questions?  (Don't give the tutorial - they can use the pre-class assignment as a reference, and we need as much in-class time to work on Schelling as possible)

* A: Schelling model (this will take the rest of class)
  * look at INSTRUCTOR-one-dimensional-segregation.md for more details about the goals, etc.
  * Setting it up: hand out pennies and nickels before class starts so you don't have to do it during the activity - have every group come up and get 20 pennies, 20 nickels!
  * Activity: make sure to check in with students frequently - this  is a complex exercise and will require you to keep a pretty close eye on things.
  * Before class ends, make sure that students know that there is a pre-class assignment and that it involves implementing the two functions discussed in the homework assignment!
