# Day 18 - The Bechdel Test

## Primary Goals for today's class

* ...

## Pre-class assignment

* None!

## In-class activity overview

* P: announcements
* D: Second half of semester project: find a model!
* A: The Bechdel Test
 
## In-class activity details

### Announcements

* P: announcements (few minutes)
	* Homework 4 posted today; due on Friday 11/18  (one more HW assignment after this before end of semester)
	* Modeling part of semester project also assigned; first deadline is next Sunday, 11/13 

### Discuss the modeling project (10 mins)

* D: discussion of the modeling component of the semester project (10 minutes)
  * The plan is for students to find a model that they're interested in, and now that they have more understanding of how modeling works they can do a more in-depth job of explaining it.
  * It does not have to relate to their data analysis project!
  * Broken down into several pieces: (1) Finding two models and some references, and getting feedback from your instructor; (2) paring it down to one model and doing more in-depth research on that model; (3) create a presentation and give a short (10 minute) talk on the model you've chosen.
  * First part is finding two models.  Writeup due Sunday (11/13).  Look at the notebook on D2L in the "semester projects" directory.
  * In class the next day, they will present these to their group mates, who will give them recommendations about which one they are going to present.
  * Students will present these during the last week of classes - we'll have more instructions out soon. 



* A: The Bechdel Test (rest of class)
  * Ask the students to download the notebook and spend a few minutes on their own reading it.
  
### Have everyone (students and instructors) download the nltk `book` collection

In a Jupyter notebook, students should run the following:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download()
```

That will open up a window like this. 

1. Select "book", 
2. press download, 
3. once the download is done you can close the window. You're good to go.

### The Bechdel Test (the rest of class)

Students will explore the roles and representation of female characters in movies. We'll focus on one movie script: _Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest_. We're providing them code building blocks in an ipynb notebook. Their job is to try to plan and assemble an analysis workflow that tries to answer whether the movie passes the Bechdel test.

**Slides for this portion of class are located in the `Slides` folder**
