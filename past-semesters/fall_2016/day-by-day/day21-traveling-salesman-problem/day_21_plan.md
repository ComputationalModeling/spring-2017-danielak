# Day 21

## Goals for today's class

* Explore Monte Carlo optimization of the Traveling Salesman problem.

## Pre-class assignment

* None.

## In-class activity overview

* P: Announcements
* D/A: Around-the-room: what model did you pick?
* P: Presentation on traveling salesman problem.
* A: MC optimization of the TPS

## In-class activity details

* P: Announcements
  * Homework 4 due on Friday!
  * Initial research for your semester project is due next Wednesday, 11/23 (before Thanksgiving)
  * Prof. O'Shea out of town
* D/A: Going around the room - what model did you pick?  (10 minutes)
  * Have each student spend ~30 seconds talking about the model that they ultimately chose - we want everybody to hear what's coming in a few weeks.
* P: Presentation on traveling salesman problem.  (5 minutes)
  * Example of how you can use Monte Carlo techniques (i.e., random numbers) to optimize.
  * Useful for solving problems that cannot easily be solved perfectly due to computational cost.
  * While it's helpful to 
* A: MC optimization of the TPS  (rest of class)
