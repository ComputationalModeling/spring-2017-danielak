# Day 20

## Goals for today's class

* Explore Monte Carlo integration in 1D and 3D

## Pre-class assignment

* None

## In-class activity overview

* P: Announcements
* D/A: model choice activity
* A: Finish up skydiver (if necessary)
* P: Brief presentation on Monte Carlo integration
* A: MC integration notebook

## In-class activity details

* P: Announcements
  * Homework 4 due on Friday
  * Prof. O'Shea out of town
  * Final choice of model due *tomorrow* (Tues. for Mon/Wed sections; Wed. for Tues/Thurs sections).  Need to upload a PDF or Jupyter notebook explaining what you chose, and why.  (This will take only a few minutes.)
  * CMSE 202 has plenty of open seats - please think about enrolling!  (See email about this as well!)
* Model choice activity (20 minutes)
  * Have the students spend a couple of minutes per person explaining to their group what models they're considering - why it's an interesting/relevant model, and what sort of methods are used for it.
  * Students will then get feedback from their group on which of their two models sound more viable/interesting
  * Students will have to commit to one by tomorrow night (night after their section, whenever that is) and we'll talk about it in class.
* Finish up skydiver exercise from last class: if necessary!  (half hour)
  * The point of this is to get the students on the right track for the skydiver assignment, since their next HW will include aspects of this.  
  * Don't have them finish the whole thing - just get the critical parts, which are numerical integration/differentiation.
* P: Brief presentation on Monte Carlo Integration (5 minutes)
  * Cover the highlights (as explained by [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_integration) ) - basically it's a method to compute integrals that is different than what we did last week, but which is useful when it's hard to set up the integral (multiple dimensions, complicated function, etc.)
* A: MC integration notebook (1 hour)
  * This is a relatively straightforward assignment; make sure students get through the first part, and if they don't get through the second part that's fine.

## Instructor feedback

**Leave feedback on what happened in class today!**
