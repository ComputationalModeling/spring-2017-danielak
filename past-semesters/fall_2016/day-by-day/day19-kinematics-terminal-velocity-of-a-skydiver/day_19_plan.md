# Day 19

## Goals for today's class

* Explore numerical integration and differentiation
* Model physical situations using numerical integration and differentiation

## Pre-class assignment

* Video on numerical integration
* Implement the rectangle rule and integrate sin(x) from 0 -> pi and e^x from -2 to 2 using steps of 0.01.  How does that compare to the analytic value?  (In terms of fractional difference, or |int_val - real_val| / |real_val|)  What happens when you make the step size larger or smaller?  
* Video on numerical differentiation
* Take derivative of the same two functions at various points - compare your values to the analytic values.  Again, how does it change when you change the interval?

## In-class activity overview

* P: Announcements
* D: Pre-class assignment
* A: Implement a trapezoidal-rule integrator
* D: Further discussion about integration of equations!
* A: Implement a physics model for stuff with air resistance
 
## In-class activity details

* P: Announcements
  * Prof. O'Shea gone next week - Prof. Xie covering for him (also no office hours for Prof. O'Shea)
  * Typo in HW4 - please re-download it!  
  * Also, for HW4 - look at the dictionary tutorial - you will need it!
  * Start HW4 early!  
  * Upcoming deadlines: data analysis project final version (Friday), modeling project two ideas (Sunday) 

* D: Pre-class assignment (5-10 minutes)
  * Have students discuss challenges, etc.
  * Walk through both rectangle rule and differentiation
* A: Implement a trapezoidal-rule integrator (20 minutes)
  * trapezoidal rule described in pre-class assignment, but give a brief recap!
  *  integrate y = 2 x^2 + 3 from -2 to +4
  * First have students break out and figure it out (A) analytically and (B) as pseudocode.
  * Then have them code it!
* A: Calculate position and acceleration for Skydiver (70 minutes)
  * Ask students to first download and read the assignment on their own (5 minutes)
  * Then give a brief reminder of how the physics works (the equations at the top of the notebook) - 5 minutes
  * Finally, ask the students to spend some time coming up with pseudo-code for their project (thinking about functions they should write, etc.) and then we'll actually code it.

## Instructor feedback

**Leave feedback on what happened in class today!**

* How you think it went
* What you felt went well
* What you and/or the students struggled with
* What changes you might make to future versions of today's activities.
