    "**Function 1:**  Write a function that creates a one-dimensional game board composed of agents of two different types (0 and 1, X and O, stars and pluses... whatever you want), where the agents are assigned to spots randomly with a 50% chance of being either type.  As arguments to the function, take in (1) the number of spots in the game board (setting the default to 32) and (2) a random seed that you will use to initialize the board (again with some default number), and return your game board.  (**Hint:** which makes more sense to describe the game board, a list or a Numpy array?  What are the tradeoffs?)  Show that your function is behaving correctly by printing out the returned game board.\n"

Make sure to check that position i is actually inside the game board (i.e., make sure the request makes sense), and ensure that it behaves correctly for agents near the edges of the game board.  Show that your function is behaving correctly by giving having it check every position in the game board you generated previously, and decide whether the agent in each spot is happy or not.  Verify by eye that it's behaving correctly.  (**Hint:** You're going to use this later, when you're trying to decide where to *put* an agent.
