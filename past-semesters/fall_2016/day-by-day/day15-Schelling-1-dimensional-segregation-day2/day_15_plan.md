# Day 15

## Goals for today's class

* Learn how simple choices can lead to complex and unexpected outcomes (i.e., emergent behavior)
* Learn how to manipulate lists 

## Pre-class assignment

* "create the game board" and "is the agent happy?" functions

## In-class activity overview

* P: Announcements
* D: Discussion of pre-class assignment
* A: Schelling model (continued)
 
## In-class activity details

* P: Announcements (few minutes)
  * Update: Homework 3 is now due next Tuesday night, November 1st
  * Preliminary data analysis project is due Friday, Oct. 28th

* D: Discussion of pre-class assignment (two functions)  (5-10 minutes)
  * Form students into groups - work through their solutions to two functions, and allow them to make copies of each others' functions if people have problems getting things to work.
  * Then, whole-class discussion about this - any questions?  (Don't spend much time on this if the students don't drive the discussion - there's a lot to do!)

* A: Continuation of the Schelling model (this will take the rest of class)
  * Uses notebook, etc. from the previous day of class - should start from right after students implement the two functions!
  * Activity: make sure to check in with students frequently - this  is a complex exercise and will require you to keep a pretty close eye on things.
