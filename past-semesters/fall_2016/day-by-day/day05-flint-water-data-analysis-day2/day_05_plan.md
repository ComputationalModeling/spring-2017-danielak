# Day 5 - Flint water quality, II

**NOTE:** Raw and processed data for today's class was obtained from the [Flint water quality study website](http://flintwaterstudy.org).

## Goals for today's class

* Be able to use Pandas to answer more complex questions with data

## Pre-class assignment

* P/A: practice with various types of data slicing, analysis, visualization in Pandas
* A: What questions do you have from the videos?  Any other concerns? 

## In-class activity overview
 
* P: discussion of group work in class.
* D: problems with pre-class assignment? How long did it take?
* D: some questions we're going to start using in class.
* A: Extracting meaning from data with plots: Flint Water Safety Data Part II
* P: end-of-class reminder: first homework assignment due Friday!  Get started early!
 
## In-class activity details

* Group work in class (5 minutes)
  * We're now going to start evaluating you on how you participate in your group.  
  * Give out handout and talk about it.  The whole point is to help everybody figure out how to work in groups.  Any questions?
  * At the end of next week we will email everybody in the section feedback.  At the end of the following week, we'll start assigning grades.

* Some questions we're going to use in class.  The point of these questions on a regular basis is for you to be thoughtful about what you're doing, and help you not "go down the rabbit hole" and lose sight of why you're trying to do something.  We'll try this for a while and see how it goes.  The questions are:
  1. What are you doing?  (Can you describe it precisely?)
  2. Why are you doing it?  (How does it fit with the solution you’re looking for?)
  3. How does what you’re doing help you?  (What will you do with the outcome when you obtain it?)
  4. What do you need to do next?

* D/P: Discussion of pre-class assignment  (5-10 minutes)
  * Small group discussion: if you have problems, see if your group members can solve them!
  * Is there anything that you want to be able to do that you can't figure out how to do?
  * Did anybody find a plot that seems particularly promising?

* A: Extracting meaning from data with plots: Flint Water Safety Data Part II
  * Big goal for today: tell us if the water quality is getting better, worse, or staying the same in Flint.
  * Before we start: point students to the Jupyter notebook that includes a tutorial for a bunch of Pandas things that they'll be able to use (and the pre-class assignment), the Pandas cheat sheet, and the pre-class assignment (all uploaded)
  * This is going to be pretty free-form - the instructors will circulate around and answer questions/make guiding suggestions, but you're supposed to do things on your own.
  * Make sure to pause periodically to check in and see how the entire class is doing - if there's an interesting point/widespread sticking point, make sure to discuss it as a whole class!

* End-of-class announcements (2 minutes):
  * First HW will be due on Friday (9/23) at 11:59 p.m.  This involves order-of-magnitude estimation and Flint water quality data, and a continuation of the project we're wrapping up today.
  * Office hours are all week - they're in the syllabus, and we have office hours on most days (and quite a bit on Friday)
  
## Instructor feedback

**Leave feedback on what happened in class today!**

* How you think it went
* What you felt went well
* What you and/or the students struggled with
* What changes you might make to future versions of today's activities.
