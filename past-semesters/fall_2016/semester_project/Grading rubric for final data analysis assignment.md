# Grading rubric for final data analysis assignment

### From the handout:

You'll hand in a Jupyter Notebook with your final analysis. It should contain both code and explanation that leads your readers through:
* The dataset you chose* Why you chose it* Your three research questions and what you found by exploring the datasets 
* Any and all computations and visualizations you createdYou will be graded on your research questions (more challenging and interesting questions will receive more points) and the way in which you answer the questions (more sophisticated analysis and informative/aesthetically appealing plots will receive more points).

---

100 points total, broken down as follows:

* Dataset choice: **10 points** - does it explain the dataset chosen and why it was chosen?  [I'm not really taking points off for missing this - lots of people skipped it and they dealt with it in earlier stages of their assignment]
* 3 questions: **30 points each**
  * **10 points** question itself
  * **10 points** analysis supporting the question
  * **10 points** clarity of plots

Extra points:

* Bonus for extra-challenging analysis
