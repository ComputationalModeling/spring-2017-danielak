# CMSE 201 final presentation - grading rubric

### Overall requirements

Each student's presentation should be roughly 6 minutes long and have appropriate visual aids.  Four points need to be addressed:

1. What is the model that you've chosen, and what is it used for?  (In other words, why is this model interesting and why should I care?)
2. How does the model work?  In other words, what are the numerical algorithms that underly the model?
3. How does this model connect to what we've done in class and to your own interests?  Explain how you could apply what you've learned in class to create a model like this.
4. What sort of data is this model compared to, and how would I decide if the model was good or bad?

Students should use plots, images, and/or animations as necessary to demonstrate how the model works, its inputs, or its outputs.

### Talk slides

Talk slides must be powerpoint or PDF, and the students can have up to 7 slides.  Guidelines for the slides are:

* The title slide should contain your name, the name of the model that you will be explaining, and the course number (CMSE 201).  You can add some sort of graphic/image/animation if you want, but you don't have to!
* The slides that answer the four questions asked above need to have titles that are short versions of the questions, and should be answered in the order that they're asked.

Slides need to effectively communicate information.  Text and figures must be **legible** and **support the presentation**.  Paragraphs of text are not allowed.

## Grading

The presentation will be graded as follows:

* 1/3 of the grade (**33 points**) comes from the oral presentation.  Is it clear and well-structured?  Does the student effectively communicate the key ideas about their model?
  * Excellent presentation:  student speaks clearly and in a logical manner, and makes their key points clear.  They use eye contact and minimally use notes. (**33 points**)
  * Good presentation: student speaks clearly and logically and conveys key points, but presentation is somewhat lacking (heavy use of notes; moderate eye contact, etc.) (**25 points**)
  * Fair presentation: student's oral presentation is substantially lacking: little eye contact, speaking too quietly to be heard or with little inflection, clarity/logical flow in speaking is sub-par, etc.  (**17 points**)
  * Poor presentation:  student's oral presentation is completely lacking: little to no eye contact, cannot be heard, there is no logical progression to the presentation. (**10 points**)
  

* 1/3 of the grade (**34 points**) comes from the student's slides.  Do the slides complement their oral presentation, and conform to the guidelines?
  * Excellent slides: Slides conform to specifications in final presentation document, including number of slides, adequately answering all questions asked, legibility.  Slides complement oral presentation. (**34 points**)
  * Good slides: Slides deviate from specifications in some minor way: too many or too few slides, not all questions ansered, some slides hard to understand (poor graphics, too much or too little text, etc.) (**26 points**)
  * Fair slides: Slides deviate from specifications in some substantial way: too many or too few slides, half or fewer of questions ansered, most slides hard to understand (poor graphics, too much or too little text, etc.)  (**18 points**)
  * Poor slides: Slides to not conform to specifications in any meaningful way. (**10 points**)

* 1/3 of the grade (**33 points**) comes from the content of the student's presentation.  Do you clearly and concisely answer all four of the questions that you were asked to answer?
  * Excellent content:  All four questions clearly and concisely answered.  (**33 points**)
  * Good content: Most of the questions clearly and concisely answered, or all questions nominally answered but some are unclear.  (**25 points**)
  * Fair content: Roughly half of the questions clearly and concisely answered, or all questions nominally answered but two are unclear.(**17 points**)
  * Poor content: Few of the questions clearly and concisely answered, or most/all questions nominally answered but most are unclear. (**10 points**)
