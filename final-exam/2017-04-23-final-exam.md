# CMSE 201 In-Class Final Exam

## What you will turn in

1. A commented Python file (`.py`) or commented Jupyter Notebook (`ipynb`) with code that runs your model.
2. Pictures of what you've drawn/created on your whiteboards
3. A written group reflection.
    1. **If you successfully got your code to run**, you'll explain it. Pretend you're writing to an 8th-grader who has some Python background but has never seen this model (or any model) and has never made plots. Your job is to get that student to fully understand your code, how it works, and why you've designed it the way you have. (For example: did you use functions? If so, why and how. If not, why not?
    2. **If your code doesn't run**, write in detail about which parts seem to be giving you errors. You must also describe what you _tried_ to do and why you and most importantly, why you thought it would work.

 ----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------
**Equity**          | All group members have a chance to speak contribute. You’re programming in pairs, or as a whole group | One person is doing most of the talking. One or more group members is staying silent through most of the discussion. One group member is spending a lot of time coding on their own and not talking to anyone
**Resourcefulness** | Ask PRECISE questions. When you have questions, you’re FIRST checking google, the Python/numpy/pandas/matplotlib documentation, and each other so that when you ask us, you can tell us what you tried.                                    | Spend a long time (more than 10-15 minutes) on something, have it NOT work, and then NOT ask for help. Or, call us over for help and just say “our code isn’t working” without a precise description of the problem.
**Sense-Making**    | When something works, understand why it works. Ask each other questions if there’s something you’re not sure of. When something doesn’t work, be able to describe what you tried, what you expected to happen, and what actually happened. | Never try to understand your code. Be unable to explain why it works. If it doesn’t work, don’t document what you tried
**Design Process**  | Make diagrams when you can. Act out the code to debug it, just like we did in our games. Have someone be the Python interpreter, other people be the agents, and have the interpreter read the code line by line to tell the agents what to do. Hand-draw graphs if you can’t get them to plot. | Keep all the code on one person’s computer. Never make diagrams, drawings, or plain English descriptions of how your code works. Never try walking through the code one line at a time, pretending to be the Python interpreter.

## Late/No-Show policy

As a reminder:

- If you show up more than 5 minutes late, you'll lose points
- If you don't show up at all (and don't have valid documentation for why), you will earn the lowest possible grade for the exam.

**Why are these rules so harsh?**

I'm glad you asked, rhetorical device. They're harsh because we're a community, and you owe it to your classmates. If you don't show up, it makes things much harder for your group.
