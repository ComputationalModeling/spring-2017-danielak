# CMSE 201 In-Class Final Exam

## What you will turn in

1. A commented Python file (`.py`) or commented Jupyter Notebook (`ipynb`) with code that runs your model.
2. Pictures of what you've drawn/created on your whiteboards
3. A written group reflection.

  1. **If you successfully got your code to run**, you'll explain it. Pretend you're writing to an 8th-grader who has some Python background but has never seen this model (or any model) and has never made plots. Your job is to get that student to fully understand your code, how it works, and why you've designed it the way you have. (For example: did you use functions? If so, why and how. If not, why not?
  2. **If your code doesn't run**, write in detail about which parts seem to be giving you errors. You must also describe what you _tried_ to do and why you and most importantly, why you thought it would work.

## How you will be graded

You'll be graded as a group, and we'll be looking at four key categories.

## Equity: Do all group members have a chance to contribute?

### Equity - How to do well

- All group members have a chance to speak contribute.
- You're programming in pairs, or as a whole group

### How to NOT do well

Category        | How to do **Well**                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | How to do **Poorly**

Equity          | All group members have a chance to speak contribute. You’re programming in pairs, or as a whole group                                                                                                                                      | One person is doing most of the talking. One or more group members is staying silent through most of the discussion. One group member is spending a lot of time coding on their own and not talking to anyone

Resourcefulness | Ask PRECISE questions. When you have questions, you’re FIRST checking google, the Python/numpy/pandas/matplotlib documentation, and each other so that when you ask us, you can tell us what you tried.                                    |
Sense-Making    | When something works, understand why it works. Ask each other questions if there’s something you’re not sure of. When something doesn’t work, be able to describe what you tried, what you expected to happen, and what actually happened. |
