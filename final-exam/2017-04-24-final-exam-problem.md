# Simulating Econophysics

## What you're aiming for

1. Your code should have **variables** for the number of rounds and the number of agents. The number of agents can be even
2. In each round, every agent who isn't broke must engage in a trade.
3. Broke agents can't engage in trades
4. Write a function that could plot the wealth of each agent as a bar chart (agent number vs. money they have)
